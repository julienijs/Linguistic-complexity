# Linguistic complexity projects
Scripts and datasets used and created for measuring linguistic complexity through information theoretic methods. This is part of [my PhD project](https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3H220490?lang=en&hl=en). Note that this is still a work in progress with semi frequent updates!
