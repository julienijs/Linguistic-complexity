 but the generacioun of crist was thus.
 whanne marie the modir of jhesu was spousid to joseph bifore thei camen togidere she was foundun hauynge of the hooli goost in the wombe.
 and joseph hir hosebonde for he was ritful and wolde not puplische hir he wolde priueli haue left hir.
 but while he thoute thes thingis lo.
 the aungel of the lord apperide in sleep to hym and seide joseph the sone of dauid nyle thou drede to take marie thi wijf.
 for that thing that is borun in hir is of the hooli goost.
 and she shal bere a sone and thou shalt clepe his name jhesus.
 for he schal make his puple saaf fro her synnes.
 for al this thing was don that it schulde be fulfillid that was seid of the lord bi a prophete seiynge lo.
 a virgyn shal haue in wombe and she schal bere a sone and thei schulen clepe his name emanuel that is to seie god with vs.
 and joseph roos fro sleepe and dide as the aungel of the lord comaundide hym and took marie his wijf.
 and he knew her not til she hadde borun her firste bigete sone and clepide his name jhesus.
 therfor whanne jhesus was borun in bethleem of juda in the daies of king eroude lo.
 astromyenes camen fro the eest to jerusalem and seiden where is he that is borun king of jewis.
 for we han seyn his sterre in the eest and we comen to worschipe him.
 but king eroude herde and was trublid and al jerusalem with hym.
 and he gaderide to gidre alle the prynces of prestis and scribis of the puple and enqueride of hem where crist shulde be borun.
 and thei seiden to hym in bethleem of juda.
 for so it is writun bi a profete and thou bethleem the lond of juda art not the leest among the prynces of juda.
 for of thee a duyk schal go out that schal gouerne my puple of israel.
 thanne eroude clepide pryueli the astromyens and lernyde bisili of hem the tyme of the sterre that apperide to hem.
 and he sente hem in to bethleem and seide go e and axe e bisili of the child and whanne ee han foundun telle e it to me that y also come and worschipe hym.
 and whanne thei hadden herd the kyng thei wenten forth.
 and lo.
 the sterre that thei sien in the eest wente bifore hem til it cam and stood aboue where the child was.
 and thei sien the sterre and ioyeden with a ful greet ioye.
 and thei entriden in to the hous and founden the child with marie his modir.
 and thei felden doun and worschipiden him.
 and whanne thei hadden openyd her tresouris thei offryden to hym iftis gold encense and myrre.
 and whanne thei hadden take an aunswere in sleep that thei schulden not turne aen to eroude thei turneden aen bi anothir weie in to her cuntrey.
 and whanne thei weren goon lo.
 the aungel of the lord apperide to joseph in sleep and seide rise vp and take the child and his modir and fle in to egipt and be thou there til that i seie to thee.
 for it is to come that eroude seke the child to destrie hym.
 and joseph roos and took the child and his modir bi nyt and wente in to egipt and he was there to the deeth of eroude.
 that it shulde be fulfillid that was seid of the lord bi the profete seiynge fro egipt y haue clepid my sone.
 thanne eroude seynge that he was disseyued of the astromyens was ful wrooth.
 and he sente and slowe alle the children that weren in bethleem and in alle the coostis therof fro two eer age and with inne aftir the tyme that he had enquerid of the astromyens.
 thanne it was fulfillid that was seid bi jeremye the profete seiynge a vois was herd an hi wepynge and moche weilyng rachel biwepynge hir sones and she wolde not be coumfortid for thei ben not.
 but whanne eroude was deed loo.
 the aungel of the lord apperide to joseph in sleep in egipt and seide ryse vp and take the child and his modir and go in to the lond of israel.
 for thei that souten the lijf of the chijld ben deed.
 joseph roos and took the child and his modir and cam in to the loond of israel.
 and he herde that archilaus regnede in judee for eroude his fadir and dredde to go thidir.
 and he was warned in sleep and wente in to the parties of galilee.
 and cam and dwelte in a citee that ys clepid nazareth that it shulde be fulfillid that was seid bi profetis for he shal be clepid a nazarey.
 in tho daies joon baptist cam and prechide in the desert of judee and seide do e penaunce for the kyngdom of heuenes shal neie.
 for this is he of whom it is seid bi ysaie the prophete seyinge a vois of a crier in desert make e redi the weies of the lord.
 make e rit the pathis of hym.
 and this joon hadde clothing of camels heeris and a girdil of skynne aboute hise leendis.
 and his mete was honysoukis and hony of the wode.
 thanne jerusalem wente out to hym and al judee and al the cuntre aboute jordan.
 and thei weren waischun of hym in jordan and knowlechiden her synnes.
 but he si manye of the farysees and of saduceis comynge to his baptym and seide to hem generaciouns of eddris who shewide to ou to fle fro the wraththe that is to come.
 therfor do e worthi fruyte of penaunce and nyle e seie with ynne ou we han abraham to fadir.
 for y seie to ou that god is myti to reise vp of these stoones the sones of abraham.
 and now the ax is put to the roote of the tree.
 therfore euery tree that makith not good fruyt shal be kit doun and shal be cast in to the fier.
 y waische ou in water in to penaunce.
 but he that shal come after me is strongere than y whos schoon y am not worthi to bere.
 he shal baptise ou in the hooli goost and fier.
 whos wynewing cloth is in his hoond and he shal fulli clense his corn flore and shal gadere his whete in to his berne.
 but the chaffe he shal brenne with fier that mai not be quenchid.
 thanne jhesus cam fro galilee in to jordan to joon to be baptised of hym.
 and joon forbede him and seide y owe to be baptisid of thee and thou comest to me.
 but jhesus answeride and seide to hym suffre nowe for thus it fallith to vs to fulfille al ritfulnesse .
 thanne joon suffride hym.
 and whanne jhesus was baptisid anoon he wente up fro the watir.
 and lo.
 heuenes weren openyd to hym and he saie the spirit of god comynge doun as a dowue and comynge on hym.
 and loo.
 a vois fro heuenes seiynge this is my louyd sone in which y haue plesid to me.
 thanne jhesus was led of a spirit in to desert to be temptid of the feend.
 and whanne he hadde fastid fourti daies and fourti nytis aftirward he hungride.
 and the tempter cam ny and seide to hym if thou art goddis sone seie that thes stoones be maad looues.
 which answeride and seide to hym it is writun not oonli in breed luyeth man but in ech word that cometh of goddis mouth.
 thanne the feend took hym in to the hooli citee and settide hym on the pynacle of the temple and seide to hym if thou art goddis sone sende thee adoun.
 for it is writun that to hise aungels he comaundide of thee and thei schulen take thee in hondis lest perauenture thou hirte thi foot at a stoon.
 eftsoone jhesus seide to hym it is writun thou shalt not tempte thi lord god.
 eftsoone the feend took hym in to a ful hi hil and schewide to hym alle the rewmes of the world and the ioye of hem.
 and seide to hym alle these y schal yue to thee if thou falle doun and worschipe me.
 thanne jhesus seide to hym goo sathanas.
 for it is writun thou schalt worschipe thi lord god and to hym aloone thou shalt serue.
 thanne the feend lafte hym.
 and lo.
 aungels camen ny and serueden to hym.
 but whanne jhesus hadde herd that joon was takun he wente in to galilee.
 and he lefte the citee of nazareth and cam and dwelte in the citee of cafarnaum biside the see in the coostis of zabulon and neptalym that it shulde be fulfillid that was seid by ysaie the profete seiynge the lond of sabulon and the lond of neptalym the weie of the see ouer jordan of galilee of hethen men the puple that walkide in derknessis saye greet lit and while men satten in the cuntre of shadewe of deth lit aroos to hem.
 fro that tyme jhesus bigan to preche and seie do e penaunce for the kyngdom of heuenes schal come ni.
 and jhesus walkide bisidis the see of galilee and saye twei britheren symount that is clepid petre and andrewe his brothir castynge nettis in to the see.
 for thei weren fischeris.
 and he seide to hem come e aftir me and y shal make ou to be maad fisscheris of men.
 and anoon thei leften the nettis and sueden hym.
 and he ede forth fro that place and saie tweyne othere britheren james of zebede and joon his brother in a schip with zebede her fadir amendynge her nettis and he clepide hem.
 and anoon thei leften the nettis and the fadir and sueden hym.
 and jhesus ede aboute al galilee techynge in the synagogis of hem and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom and heelynge euery languor and eche sekenesse among the puple.
 and his fame wente in to al sirie.
 and thei brouten to hym alle that weren at male ese and that weren take with dyuerse languores and turmentis and hem that hadden feendis and lunatike men and men in palesy and he heelide hem.
 and ther sueden hym myche puple of galile and of decapoli and of jerusalem and of judee and of biende jordan.
 and jhesus seynge the puple wente vp in to an hil.
 and whanne he was set hise disciplis camen to hym.
 and he openyde his mouth and taute hem and seide blessed ben pore men in spirit for the kyngdom of heuenes is herne.
 blessid ben mylde men for thei schulen welde the erthe.
 blessid ben thei that mornen for thei schulen be coumfortid.
 blessid ben thei that hungren and thristen ritwisnesse for thei schulen be fulfillid.
 blessid ben merciful men for thei schulen gete merci.
 blessid ben thei that ben of clene herte for thei schulen se god.
 blessid ben pesible men for thei schulen be clepid goddis children.
 blessid ben thei that suffren persecusioun for ritfulnesse for the kingdam of heuenes is herne.
 e schulen be blessid whanne men schulen curse ou and schulen pursue ou and shulen seie al yuel aens ou liynge for me.
 ioie e and be e glad for oure meede is plenteuouse in heuenes.
 for so thei han pursued also profetis that weren bifor ou.
 e ben salt of the erthe.
 that if the salt vanysche awey whereynne schal it be saltid.
 to no thing it is worth ouere no but that it be cast out and be defoulid of men.
 e ben lit of the world.
 a citee set on an hil may not be hid.
 ne me teendith not a lanterne and puttith it vndur a busschel but on a candilstike that it yue lit to alle that ben in the hous.
 so schyne oure lit befor men that thei se oure goode werkis and glorifie oure fadir that is in heuenes.
 nil e deme that y cam to vndo the lawe or the profetis.
 y cam not to vndo the lawe but to fulfille.
 forsothe y seie to ou til heuene and erthe passe o lettir or o titel shal not passe fro the lawe til alle thingis be doon.
 therfor he that brekith oon of these leeste maundementis and techith thus men schal be clepid the leste in the rewme of heuenes.
 but he that doith and techith schal be clepid greet in the kyngdom of heuenes.
 and y seie to ou that but our ritfulnesse be more plenteuouse than of scribis and of farisees e schulen not entre into the kyngdom of heuenes.
 e han herd that it was seid to elde men thou schalt not slee.
 and he that sleeth schal be gilti to doom.
 but y seie to ou that ech man that is wrooth to his brothir schal be gilti to doom.
 and he that seith to his brother fy.
 schal be gilti to the counseil.
 but he that seith fool schal be gilti to the fier of helle.
 therfor if thou offrist thi ifte at the auter and ther thou bithenkist that thi brothir hath sum what aens thee leeue there thi ifte bifor the auter and go first to be recounselid to thi brothir and thanne thou schalt come and schalt offre thi ifte.
 be thou consentynge to thin aduersarie soone while thou art in the weie with hym lest perauenture thin aduersarie take thee to the domesman and the domesman take thee to the mynystre and thou be sent in to prisoun.
 treuli y seie to thee thou shalt not go out fro thennus til thou elde the last ferthing.
 e han herd that it was seid to elde men thou schalt do no letcherie.
 but y seie to ou that euery man that seeth a womman for to coueite hir hath now do letcherie bi hir in his herte.
 that if thi rit ie sclaundre thee pulle hym out and caste fro thee.
 for it spedith to thee that oon of thi membris perische than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
 and if thi rit hond sclaundre thee kitte hym aweye and caste fro thee.
 for it spedith to thee that oon of thi membris perische than that al thi bodi go in to helle.
 and it hath be seyd who euere leeueth his wijf yue he to hir a libel of forsakyng.
 but y seie to ou that euery man that leeueth his wijf outtakun cause of fornycacioun makith hir to do letcherie and he that weddith the forsakun wijf doith auowtrye.
 eftsoone e han herd that it was seid to elde men thou schalt not forswere but thou schalt elde thin othis to the lord.
 but y seie to ou that e swere not for ony thing.
 nethir bi heuene for it is the trone of god.
 nether bi the erthe for it is the stole of his feet.
 nether bi jerusalem for it is the citee of a greet kyng.
 nether thou shalt not swere bi thin heed for thou maist not make oon heere white ne blacke.
 but be oure word he he.
 nay nay.
 and that that is more than these is of yuel.
 e han herd that it hath be seid ie for ie and tothe for tothe.
 but y seie to ou that e aenstonde not an yuel man.
 but if ony smyte thee in the rit cheke schewe to him also the tothir.
 and to hym that wole stryue with thee in doom and take awey thi coote leeue thou to him also thi mantil.
 and who euer constreyneth thee a thousynde pacis go thou with hym othir tweyne.
 yue thou to hym that axith of thee and turne not awey fro hym that wole borewe of thee.
 e han herd that it was seid thou shalt loue thi neibore and hate thin enemye.
 but y seie to ou loue e oure enemyes do e wel to hem that hatiden ou and preye e for hem that pursuen and sclaundren ou.
 that e be the sones of our fadir that is in heuenes that makith his sunne to rise vpon goode and yuele men and reyneth on iust men and vniuste.
 for if e louen hem that louen ou what mede schulen e han.
 whether pupplicans doon not this.
 and if e greten oure britheren oonli what schulen e do more.
 ne doon not hethene men this.
 therfore be e parfit as oure heuenli fadir is parfit.
 takith hede that e do not oure ritwisnesse bifor men to be seyn of hem ellis e schulen haue no meede at oure fadir that is in heuenes.
 therfore whanne thou doist almes nyle thou trumpe tofore thee as ypocritis doon in synagogis and stretis that thei be worschipid of men.
 sotheli y seie to ou they han resseyued her meede.
 but whanne thou doist almes knowe not thi left hond what thi rit hond doith that thin almes be in hidils and thi fadir that seeth in hiddils schal quyte thee.
 and whanne e preyen e schulen not be as ipocritis that louen to preye stondynge in synagogis and corneris of stretis to be seyn of men.
 treuli y seie to ou thei han resseyued her meede.
 but whanne thou schalt preye entre in to thi couche and whanne the dore is schet preye thi fadir in hidils and thi fadir that seeth in hidils schal elde to thee.
 but in preiyng nyle ee speke myche as hethene men doon for thei gessen that thei ben herd in her myche speche.
 therfor nyle e be maad lich to hem for our fadir woot what is nede to ou bifore that e axen hym.
 and thus e schulen preye oure fadir that art in heuenes halewid be thi name.
 thi kyngdoom come to.
 be thi wille don in erthe as in heuene.
 yue to vs this dai oure breed ouer othir substaunce.
 and foryue to vs oure dettis as we foryuen to oure dettouris.
 and lede vs not in to temptacioun but delyuere vs fro yuel.
 amen.
 for if e foryuen to men her synnes oure heuenli fadir schal foryue to ou oure trespassis.
 sotheli if e foryuen not to men nether oure fadir schal foryue to ou oure synnes.
 but whanne e fasten nyle e be maad as ypocritis sorewful for thei defacen hem silf to seme fastyng to men.
 treuli y seie to ou they han resseyued her meede.
 but whanne thou fastist anoynte thin heed and waische thi face that thou be not seen fastynge to men but to thi fadir that is in hidlis and thi fadir that seeth in priuey shal elde to thee.
 nile e tresoure to ou tresouris in erthe where ruste and moute destrieth and where theues deluen out and stelen.
 but gadere to ou tresouris in heuene where nether ruste ne moute distrieth and where theues deluen not out ne stelen.
 for where thi tresoure is there also thin herte is.
 the lanterne of thi bodi is thin ie.
 if thin ie be symple al thi bodi shal be litful.
 but if thin ie be weiward al thi bodi shal be derk.
 if thanne the lit that is in thee be derknessis how grete schulen thilk derknessis be.
 no man may serue tweyn lordis for ethir he schal hate the toon and loue the tother.
 ethir he shal susteyne the toon and dispise the tothir.
 e moun not serue god and richessis.
 therfor i seie to ou that e be not bisi to oure lijf what e schulen ete.
 nether to oure bodi with what e schulen be clothid.
 whether lijf is not more than meete and the bodie more than cloth.
 biholde e the foulis of the eire for thei sowen not nethir repen nethir gaderen in to bernes.
 and oure fadir of heuene fedith hem.
 whether e ben not more worthi than thei.
 but who of ou thenkynge mai putte to his stature o cubit.
 and of clothing what ben e bisye.
 biholde e the lilies of the feeld how thei wexen.
 thei trauelen not nether spynnen.
 and y seie to ou salomon in al his glorie was not keuered as oon of these.
 and if god clothith thus the hei of the feeld that to an ouen hou myche more ou of litel feith.
 therfor nyle e be bisi seiynge what schulen we ete.
 or what schulen we drinke.
 or with what thing schulen we be keuered.
 for hethene men seken alle these thingis.
 and oure fadir woot that e han nede to alle these thingis.
 therfor seke e first the kyngdom of god and his ritfulnesse and alle these thingis shulen be cast to ou.
 therfor nyle e be bisy in to the morew for the morew shal be bisi to hym silf.
 for it suffisith to the dai his owen malice.
 nile e deme that e be not demed.
 for in what doom e demen e schulen be demed and in what mesure e meten it schal be meten aen to ou.
 but what seest thou a litil mote in the ie of thi brother and seest not a beem in thin owne ie.
 or hou seist thou to thi brothir brothir suffre i schal do out a mote fro thin ie and lo.
 a beem is in thin owne ie.
 ipocrite do thou out first the beem of thin ie and thanne thou schalt se to do out the mote of the ie of thi brothir.
 nile e yue hooli thing to houndis nethir caste e oure margaritis bifore swyne lest perauenture thei defoulen hem with her feet and the houndis be turned and al totere ou.
 axe e and it schal be ouun to ou.
 seke e and e schulen fynde.
 knocke e and it schal be openyd to ou.
 for ech that axith takith.
 and he that sekith fyndith.
 and it schal be openyd to hym that knockith.
 what man of ou is that if his sone axe hym breed whethir he wole take hym a stoon.
 or if he axe fische whether he wole take hym an edder.
 therfor if e whanne e ben yuele men kunnen yue good iftis to oure sones hou myche more oure fadir that is in heuenes schal yue good thingis to men that axen hym.
 therfor alle thingis what euere thingis e wolen that men do to ou do e to hem for this is the lawe and the prophetis.
 entre e bi the streyt ate.
 for the ate that ledith to perdicioun is large and the weie is broode and there ben many that entren bi it.
 hou streit is the ate and narw the weye that ledith to lijf and ther ben fewe that fynden it.
 be e war of fals prophetis that comen to ou in clothingis of scheep but withynneforth thei ben as wolues of raueyn.
 of her fruytis e schulen knowe hem.
 whether men gaderen grapis of thornes or figus of breris.
 so euery good tre makith good fruytis.
 but an yuel tre makith yuel fruytis.
 a good tre may not make yuel fruytis nethir an yuel tre make good fruytis.
 euery tre that makith not good fruyt schal be kyt doun and schal be cast in to the fier.
 therfor of her fruytis e schulen knowe hem.
 not ech man that seith to me lord lord schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
 but he that doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes he schal entre in to the kyngdoom of heuenes.
 many schulen seie to me in that dai lord lord whether we han not prophesied in thi name and han caste out feendis in thi name and han doon many vertues in thi name.
 and thanne y schal knouleche to hem that y knewe ou neuere.
 departe awei fro me e that worchen wickidnesse.
 therfor ech man that herith these my wordis and doith hem schal be maad lijk to a wise man that hath bildid his hous on a stoon.
 and reyn felde doun and flodis camen and wyndis blewen and russchiden in to that hous.
 and it felde not doun for it was foundun on a stoon.
 and euery man that herith these my wordis and doith hem not is lijk to a fool that hath bildid his hous on grauel.
 and reyn cam doun and floodis camen and wyndis blewen and thei hurliden aen that hous.
 and it felde doun and the fallyng doun therof was greet.
 and it was doon whanne jhesus hadde endid these wordis the puple wondride on his techyng.
 for he taute hem as he that hadde power and not as the scribis of hem and the farisees.
 but whanne jhesus was come doun fro the hil mych puple suede hym.
 and loo.
 a leprouse man cam and worschipide hym and seide lord if thou wolt thou maist make me clene.
 and jhesus helde forth the hoond and touchide hym and seide y wole be thou maad cleene.
 and anoon the lepre of him was clensid.
 and jhesus seide to hym se seie thou to no man.
 but go shewe thee to the prestis and offre the ift that moyses comaundide in witnessyng to hem.
 and whanne he hadde entrid in to cafarnaum the centurien neiede to him and preiede him and seide lord my childe lijth in the hous sijk on the palesie and is yuel turmentid.
 and jhesus seide to him y schal come and schal heele him.
 and the centurien answeride and seide to hym lord y am not worthi that thou entre vndur my roof.
 but oonli seie thou bi word and my childe shal be heelid.
 for whi y am a man ordeyned vndur power and haue knytis vndir me.
 and y seie to this go and he goith.
 and to another come and he cometh.
 and to my seruaunt do this and he doith it.
 and jhesus herde these thingis and wondride and seide to men that sueden him treuli y seie to ou y foond not so greet feith in israel.
 and y seie to ou that many schulen come fro the eest and the west and schulen reste with abraham and ysaac and jacob in the kyngdom of heuenes.
 but the sones of the rewme schulen be cast out in to vtmer derknessis.
 there schal be wepyng and grynting of teeth.
 and jhesus seide to the centurioun go and as thou hast bileuyd be it doon to thee.
 and the child was heelid fro that hour.
 and whanne jhesus was comun in to the hous of symount petre he say his wyues modir liggynge and shakun with feueris.
 and he touchide hir hoond and the feuer lefte hir.
 and she roos and seruede hem.
 and whanne it was euen thei brouten to hym manye that hadden deuelis and he castide out spiritis bi word and heelide alle that weren yuel at ese.
 that it were fulfillid that was seid by ysaie the profete seiynge he took oure infirmytees and bar oure siknessis.
 and jhesus say myche puple aboute him and bade hise disciplis go ouer the watir.
 and a scribe neiede and seide to hym maistir y shal sue thee whidir euer thou schalt go.
 and jhesus seide to hym foxis han dennes and briddis of heuene han nestis but mannus sone hath not where he schal reste his heed.
 anothir of his disciplis seide to him lord suffre me to go first and birie my fader.
 but jhesus seide to hym sue thou me and lete deed men birie her deede men.
 and whanne he was goon vp in to a litil schip his disciplis sueden hym.
 and loo.
 a greet stiring was maad in the see so that the schip was hilid with wawes.
 but he slepte.
 and hise disciplis camen to hym and reysiden hym and seiden lord saue vs.
 we perischen.
 and jhesus seide to hem what ben e of litil feith agaste.
 thanne he roos and comaundide to the wyndis and the see and a greet pesibilnesse was maad.
 and men wondriden and seiden what maner man is he this for the wyndis and the see obeischen to him.
 and whanne jhesus was comun ouer the watir in to the cuntre of men of gerasa twey men metten hym that hadden deuelis and camen out of graues ful woode so that noo man myte go bi that weie.
 and lo.
 thei crieden and seiden what to vs and to thee jhesu the sone of god.
 art thou comun hidir bifore the tyme to turmente vs.
 and not fer fro hem was a flocke of many swyne lesewynge.
 and the deuelis preyeden hym and seiden if thou castist out vs fro hennes sende vs in to the droue of swyne.
 and he seide to hem go e.
 and thei eden out and wenten in to the swyne.
 and loo.
 in a greet bire al the droue wente heedlyng in to the see and thei weren deed in the watris.
 and the hirdis fledden a wey and camen in to the citee and telden alle these thingis and of hem that hadden the feendis.
 and lo.
 al the citee wente out aens jhesu.
 and whanne thei hadden seyn hym thei preieden that he wolde passe fro her coostis.
 and jhesus wente vp in to a boot and passide ouer the watir and cam in to his citee.
 and lo.
 thei brouten to hym a man sike in palesie liggynge in a bed.
 and jhesus saw the feith of hem and seide to the man sike in palesye sone haue thou trist.
 thi synnes ben forouun to thee.
 and lo.
 summe of the scribis seiden withynne hem silf this blasfemeth.
 and whanne jhesus hadde seyn her thoutis he seide wherto thenken e yuele thingis in oure hertis.
 what is litere to seye thi synnes ben forouun to thee ethir to seie rise thou and walke.
 but that e wite that mannus sone hath power to foryue synnes in erthe thanne he seide to the sijk man in palesie rise vp.
 take thi bed and go in to thin hous.
 and he roos and wente in to his hous.
 and the puple seynge dredde and glorifiede god that af suche power to men.
 and whanne jhesus passide fro thennus he say a man matheu bi name sittynge in a tolbothe.
 and he seide to hym sue thou me.
 and he roos and folewide hym.
 and it was don the while he sat at the mete in the hous lo.
 many pupplicans and synful men camen and saten at the mete with jhesu and hise disciplis.
 and farisees sien and seiden to hise disciplis whi etith oure maister with pupplicans and synful men.
 and jhesus herde and seide a leche is not nedeful to men that faren wel but to men that ben yuel at ese.
 but go e and lerne what it is y wole merci and not sacrifice.
 for i cam not to clepe ritful men but synful men.
 thanne the disciplis of joon camen to hym and seiden whi we and farisees fasten ofte but thi disciplis fasten not.
 and jhesus seide to hem whether the sones of the spouse moun morne as long as the spouse is with hem.
 but daies schulen come whanne the spouse schal be takun a wei fro hem and thanne thei schulen faste.
 and no man putteth a clout of buystous clothe in to an elde clothing.
 for it doith awey the fulnesse of the cloth and a wers breking is maad.
 nethir men putten newe wyne in to elde botelis ellis the botels ben tobroke and distried and the wyn sched out.
 but men putten newe wyne in to newe botels and bothe ben kept.
 whiles that jhesus spak thes thingis to hem lo.
 a prince cam and worschipide hym and seide lord my douter is now deed.
 but come thou and putte thin hond on hir and she schal lyue.
 and jhesus roos and hise disciplis and sueden hym.
 and lo.
 a womman that hadde the blodi flux twelue ere neiede bihynde and touchide the hem of his cloth.
 for sche seide with ynne hir self if y touche oonli the cloth of hym y schal be saaf.
 and jhesus turnede and say hir and seide doutir haue thou trist.
 thi feith hath maad thee saaf.
 and the womman was hool fro that our.
 and whanne jhesus cam in to the hous of the prince and say mynstrallis and the puple makynge noise he seide go e a wei for the damysel is not deed but slepith.
 and thei scornyden hym.
 and whanne the folc was put out he wente in and helde hir hond.
 and the damysel roos.
 and this fame wente out in to al that loond.
 and whanne jhesus passide fro thennus twei blynde men criynge sueden hym and seiden thou sone of dauid haue merci on vs.
 and whanne he cam in to the hous the blynde men camen to hym.
 and jhesus seide to hem what wolen e that i do to ou.
 and thei seiden lord that oure ien be opened.
 and jhesus seide bileuen e that y mai do this thing to ou.
 thei seien to him he lord.
 thanne he touchide her ien and seide aftir oure feith be it doon to ou.
 and the ien of hem were opened.
 and jhesus thretenede hem and seide se e that no man wite.
 but thei eden out and diffameden hym thorou al that lond.
 and whanne thei weren gon out loo.
 thei brouten to hym a doumbe man hauynge a deuel.
 and whanne the deuel was cast out the doumb man spak.
 and the puple wondride and seide it hath not be say thus in israel.
 but the farisees seiden in the prince of deuelis he castith out deuelis.
 and jhesus wente aboute alle the citees and castels techinge in the synagogis of hem and prechynge the gospel of the kyngdom and helynge euery langour and euery sijknesse.
 and he si the puple and hadde reuthe on hem.
 for thei weren trauelid and liggynge as scheep not hauynge a scheepherde.
 thanne he seide to hise disciplis sotheli there is myche ripe corn but fewe werk men.
 therfor preye e the lord of the ripe corn that he sende werke men in to his ripe corn.
 and whanne his twelue disciplis weren clepid togidere he af to hem powere of vnclene spiritis to caste hem out of men and to heele eueri langour and sijknesse.
 and these ben the names of the twelue apostlis.
 the firste symount that is clepid petre and andrew his brothir.
 james of zebede and joon his brothir.
 filip and bartholomeu.
 thomas and matheu pupplican.
 and james alfey and tadee.
 symount chananee and judas scarioth that bitrayede crist.
 jhesus sente these twelue and comaundide hem and seide go e not in to the weie of hethene men and entre e not in to the citees of samaritans.
 but rather go e to the scheep of the hous of israel that han perischid.
 and go e and preche e and seie that the kyngdam of heuenes shal neie.
 heele e sike men reise e deede men clense e mesels caste e out deuelis.
 freeli e han takun freli yue e.
 nyle e welde gold nether siluer ne money in oure girdlis not a scrippe in the weie nether twei cootis nethir shoon nether a erde.
 for a werkman is worthi his mete.
 in to what euere citee or castel e schulen entre axe e who therynne is worthi and there dwelle e til e go out.
 and whanne e goon in to an hous grete e it and seyn pees to this hous.
 and if thilk hous be worthi oure pees schal come on it.
 but if that hous be not worthi oure pees schal turne aen to ou.
 and who euere resseyueth not ou nethir herith oure wordis go e fro that hous or citee and sprenge of the dust of oure feet.
 treuly y seie to ou it shal be more suffrable to the loond of men of sodom and of gommor in the dai of iugement than to thilke citee.
 y sende ou as scheep in the myddil of wolues.
 therfor be e sli as serpentis and symple as dowues.
 but be e war of men for thei schulen take ou in counseilis and thei schulen bete ou in her synagogis.
 and to meyris or presidentis and to kyngis e schulen be lad for me in witnessyng to hem and to the hethen men.
 but whanne thei take ou nyle e thenke hou or what thing e schulen speke for it shal be ouun to ou in that our what e schulen speke.
 for it ben not e that speken but the spirit of oure fadir that spekith in ou.
 and the brother shal take the brother in to deeth and the fader the sone and sones schulen rise aens fadir and modir and schulen turmente hem bi deeth.
 and e schulen be in hate to alle men for my name.
 but he that shall dwelle stille in to the ende shal be saaf.
 and whanne thei pursuen ou in this citee fle e in to anothir.
 treuli y seie to ou e schulen not ende the citees of israel tofor that mannus sone come.
 the disciple is not aboue the maistir ne the seruaunt aboue hys lord.
 it is ynow to the disciple that he be as his maistir and to the seruaunt as his lord.
 if thei han clepid the hosebonde man belsabub hou myche more his houshold meyne.
 therfor drede e not hem.
 for no thing is hid that schal not be shewid.
 and no thing is priuey that schal not be wist.
 that thing that y seie to ou in derknessis seie e in the lit.
 and preche e on housis that thing that e heeren in the ere.
 and nyle e drede hem that sleen the bodi.
 for thei moun not sle the soule.
 but rather drede e hym that mai lese bothe soule and bodi in to helle.
 whether twei sparewis ben not seeld for an halpeny.
 and oon of hem shal not falle on the erthe with outen oure fadir.
 and alle the heeris of oure heed ben noumbrid.
 therfor nyle e drede.
 e ben betere than many sparewis.
 therfor euery man that schal knouleche me bifore men y shal knouleche hym bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
 but he that shal denye me bifor men and i shal denye him bifor my fadir that is in heuenes.
 nile e deme that y cam to sende pees in to erthe.
 y cam not to sende pees but swerd.
 for y cam to departe a man aens his fadir and the doutir aens hir modir and the sones wijf aens the housbondis modir.
 and the enemyes of a man ben thei that ben homeli with him.
 he that loueth fadir or modir more than me is not worthi to me.
 and he that loueth sone or douter ouer me is not worthi to me.
 and he that takith not his croos and sueth me is not worthi to me.
 he that fyndith his lijf shal lose it.
 and he that lesith his lijf for me shal fynde it.
 he that resseyueth ou resseyueth me.
 and he that resseyueth me resseyueth hym that sente me.
 he that resseyueth a prophete in the name of a prophete shal take the mede of a prophete.
 and he that resseyueth a iust man in the name of a iust man schal take the mede of a iust man.
 and who euer yueth drynke to oon of these leeste a cuppe of coolde watir oonli in the name of a disciple treuli y seie to ou he shal not leese his mede.
 and it was doon whanne jhesus hadde endid he comaundide to hise twelue disciplis and passide fro thennus to teche and preche in the citees of hem.
 but whanne joon in boondis hadde herd the werkis of crist he sente tweyne of hise disciplis and seide to him art thou he that schal come or we abiden another.
 and jhesus answeride and seide to hem go e and telle aen to joon tho thingis that e han herd and seyn.
 blynde men seen crokid men goon meselis ben maad clene deefe men heren deed men rysen aen pore men ben takun to prechyng of the gospel.
 and he is blessid that shal not be sclaundrid in me.
 and whanne thei weren goon awei jhesus bigan to seie of joon to the puple what thing wenten e out in to desert to se.
 a reed wawed with the wynd.
 or what thing wenten e out to see.
 a man clothid with softe clothis.
 thei that ben clothid with softe clothis ben in the housis of kyngis.
 but what thing wenten e out to se.
 a prophete.
 he y seie to ou and more than a prophete.
 for this is he of whom it is writun lo.
 y sende myn aungel bifor thi face that shal make redi thi weye bifor thee.
 treuli y seie to ou ther roos noon more than joon baptist among the children of wymmen.
 but he that is lesse in the kyngdom of heuenes is more than he.
 and fro the daies of joon baptist til now the kyngdom of heuenes suffrith violence and violent men rauyschen it.
 for alle prophetis and the lawe til to joon prophecieden.
 and if e wolen resseyue he is elie that is to come.
 he that hath eris of heryng here he.
 but to whom schal y gesse this generacioun lijk.
 it is lijk to children sittynge in chepyng that crien to her peeris and seien we han songun to ou and e han not daunsid.
 we han morned to ou and e han not weilid.
 for joon cam nether etynge ne drynkynge and thei seien he hath a deuel.
 the sone of man cam etynge and drynkynge and thei seien lo.
 a man a glotoun and a drinkere of wijne and a freend of pupplicans and of synful men.
 and wisdom is iustified of her sones.
 thanne jhesus bigan to seye repreef to citees in whiche ful manye vertues of him weren doon for thei diden not penaunce.
 wo to thee.
 corosaym woo to thee.
 bethsaida.
 for if the vertues that ben doon in ou hadden be doon in tyre and sidon sumtyme thei hadden don penaunce in heyre and aische.
 netheles y seie to ou it schal be lesse peyne to tire and sidon in the dai of doom than to ou.
 and thou cafarnaum whethir thou schalt be arerid vp in to heuene.
 thou shalt go doun in to helle.
 for if the vertues that ben don in thee hadden be don in sodom perauenture thei schulden haue dwellid in to this dai.
 netheles y seie to ou that to the lond of sodom it schal be lesse peyne in the dai of doom than to thee.
 in thilke tyme jhesus answeride and seide y knowleche to thee fadir lord of heuene and of erthe for thou hast hid these thingis fro wijse men and redi and hast schewid hem to litle children.
 so fadir for so it was plesynge to fore thee.
 alle thingis ben ouune to me of my fadir.
 and no man knewe the sone but the fadir nethir ony man knewe the fadir but the sone and to whom the sone wolde schewe.
 alle e that traueilen and ben chargid come to me and y schal fulfille ou.
 take e my ok on ou and lerne e of me for y am mylde and meke in herte.
 and e schulen fynde reste to oure soulis.
 for my ok is softe and my charge lit.
 in that tyme jhesus wente bi cornes in the sabot day.
 and hise disciplis hungriden and bigunnen to plucke the eris of corn and to ete.
 and fariseis seynge seiden to hym lo.
 thi disciplis don that thing that is not leueful to hem to do in sabatis.
 and he seide to hem whether e han not red what dauid dide whanne he hungride and thei that weren with hym.
 hou he entride in to the hous of god and eet looues of proposicioun whiche looues it was not leueful to hym to ete nether to hem that weren with hym but to prestis aloone.
 or whether e han not red in the lawe that in sabotis prestis in the temple defoulen the sabotis and thei ben with oute blame.
 and y seie to ou that here is a gretter than the temple.
 and if e wisten what it is y wole merci and not sacrifice e schulden neuer haue condempned innocentis.
 for mannus sone is lord he of the sabat.
 and whanne he passide fro thennus he cam in to the synagoge of hem.
 and lo.
 a man that hadde a drye hoond.
 and thei axiden hym and seiden whether it be leueful to hele in the sabot.
 that thei schulden acuse hym.
 and he seide to hem what man of ou schal be that hath o scheep and if it falle in to a diche in the sabotis whether he shal not holde and lifte it vp.
 how myche more is a man better than a scheep.
 therfor it is leueful to do good in the sabatis.
 thanne he seide to the man stretche forth thin hoond.
 and he straute forth.
 and it was restorid to heelthe as the tothir.
 and the farisees wenten out and maden a counsel aens hym hou thei schulden distrie hym.
 and jhesus knewe it and wente awei fro thennus.
 and many sueden hym and he helide hem alle.
 and he comaundide to hem that thei schulden not make hym knowun.
 that that thing were fulfillid that was seid by isaie the prophete seiynge lo.
 my child whom y haue chosun my derling in whom it hath wel plesid to my soule.
 y shal put my spirit on him and he shal telle dom to hethen men.
 he shal not stryue ne crye nethir ony man shal here his voice in stretis.
 a brisid rehed he shal not breke and he schal not quenche smokynge flax til he caste out doom to victorie.
 and hethene men schulen hope in his name.
 thanne a man blynde and doumbe that hadde a feend was brout to hym.
 and he helide hym so that he spak and say.
 and al the puple wondride and seide whether this be the sone of dauid.
 but the farisees herden and seiden he this casteth not out feendis but in belsabub prince of feendis.
 and jhesus witynge her thoutis seide to hem eche kingdom departid aens it silf schal be desolatid and eche cite or hous departid aens it self schal not stonde.
 and if satanas castith out satanas he is departid aens him silf.
 therfor hou schal his kingdom stonde.
 and if y in belsabub caste out deuelis in whom oure sones casten out.
 therfor thei schulen be oure domes men.
 but if y in the spirit of god caste out feendis thanne the kyngdom of god is comen in to ou.
 ethir hou may ony man entre in to the hous of a stronge man and take awey hise vesselis but he first bynde the stronge man and thanne he schal spuyle his hous.
 he that is not with me is aens me.
 and he that gaderith not togidere with me scaterith abrood.
 therfor i seie to ou al synne and blasfemye shal be forouun to men but the spirit of blasfemye shal not be forouun.
 and who euere seith a word aens mannus sone it shal be forouun to him.
 but who that seieth a word aens the hooli goost it shal not be forouun to hym nether in this world ne in the tothir.
 ethir make e the tree good and his fruyt good.
 ether make e the tree yuel and his fruyt yuel.
 for a tree is knowun of the fruyt.
 e generacioun of eddris hou moun e speke goode thingis whanne e ben yuele.
 for the mouth spekith of plente of the herte.
 a good man bryngith forth good thingis of good tresoure and an yuel man bringith forth yuel thingis of yuel tresoure.
 and y seie to ou that of euery idel word that men speken thei schulen elde resoun therof in the dai of doom.
 for of thi wordis thou schalt be iustified and of thi wordis thou shalt be dampned.
 thanne summe of the scribis and farisees answeriden to hym and seiden mayster we wolen se a tokne of thee.
 which answeride and seide to hem an yuel kynrede and a spouse brekere sekith a tokene and a tokene shal not be ouun to it but the tokene of jonas the prophete.
 for as jonas was in the wombe of a whal thre daies and thre nytis so mannus sone shal be in the herte of the erthe thre daies and thre nytis.
 men of nynyue schulen rise in doom with this generacioun and schulen condempne it.
 for thei diden penaunce in the prechyng of jonas and lo.
 here a gretter than jonas.
 the queene of the south shal rise in doom with this generacioun and schal condempne it.
 for she cam fro the eendis of the erthe to here the wisdom of salomon and lo.
 here a gretter than salomon.
 whanne an vnclene spirit goith out fro a man he goith bi drie places and sekith rest and fyndith not.
 thanne he seith y shal turne aen in to myn hous fro whannys y wente out.
 and he cometh and fyndith it voide and clensid with besyms and maad faire.
 thanne he goith and takith with him seuene othere spiritis worse than hym silf.
 and thei entren and dwellen there.
 and the laste thingis of that man ben maad worse than the formere.
 so it shal be to this worste generacioun.
 it whil he spak to the puple lo.
 his modir and his bretheren stoden with outeforth sekynge to speke to hym.
 and a man seide to hym lo.
 thi modir and thi britheren stonden with outeforth sekynge thee.
 he answeride to the man that spak to hym and seide who is my modir.
 and who ben my britheren.
 and he helde forth his hoond in to hise disciplis and seide lo.
 my modir and my bretheren.
 for who euer doith the wille of my fadir that is in heuenes he is my brothir and sistir and modir.
 in that dai jhesus ede out of the hous and sat bisidis the see.
 and myche puple was gaderid to hym so that he wente up in to a boot and sat.
 and al the puple stood on the brenke.
 and he spac to hem many thingis in parablis and seide lo.
 he that sowith ede out to sowe his seed.
 and while he sowith summe seedis felden bisidis the weie and briddis of the eir camen and eeten hem.
 but othere seedis felden in to stony places where thei hadden not myche erthe.
 and anoon thei sprongen vp for thei hadden not depnesse of erthe.
 but whanne the sonne was risun thei swaliden and for thei hadden not roote thei drieden vp.
 and other seedis felden among thornes.
 and thornes woxen vp and strangeleden hem.
 but othere seedis felden in to good lond and auen fruyt.
 summe an hundrid foold an othir sixti foold an othir thritti foold.
 he that hath eris of heryng here he.
 and the disciplis camen ny and seiden to him whi spekist thou in parablis to hem.
 and he answeride and seide to hem for to ou it is ouun to knowe the priuytees of the kyngdom of heuenes.
 but it is not ouun to hem.
 for it shal be ouun to hym that hath and he shal haue plente.
 but if a man hath not also that thing that he hath shal be takun awei fro hym.
 therfor y speke to hem in parablis for thei seynge seen not and thei herynge heren not nether vndurstonden.
 that the prophesie of ysaie seiynge be fulfillid in hem with heryng e schulen here and e shulen not vndurstonde.
 and e seynge schulen se and e shulen not se.
 for the herte of this puple is greetli fattid and thei herden heuyli with eeris and thei han closed her ien lest sumtime thei seen with ien and with eeris heeren and vndirstonden in herte and thei be conuertid and y heele hem.
 but oure ien that seen ben blesside and oure eeris that heren.
 forsothe y seie to ou that manye profetis and iust men coueitiden to se tho thingis that e seen and thei sayn not and to heere tho thingis that e heren and thei herden not.
 therfor here e the parable of the sowere.
 ech that herith the word of the rewme and vndirstondith not the yuel spirit cometh and rauyschith that that is sowun in his herte.
 this it is that is sowun bisidis the weie.
 but this that is sowun on the stony loond this it is that herith the word of god and anoon with ioye takith it.
 and he hath not roote in hym silf but is temporal.
 for whanne tribulacioun and persecucioun is maad for the word anoon he is sclaundrid.
 but he that is sowun in thornes is this that heerith the word and the bisynesse of this world and the fallace of ritchessis strangulith the word and it is maad with outen fruyt.
 but he that is sowun in to good loond is this that herith the word and vnderstondeth and bryngith forth fruyt.
 and summe makith an hundrid fold treuli anothir sixti fold and another thritti fold.
 anothir parable jhesus puttide forth to hem and seide the kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a man that sewe good seed in his feld.
 and whanne men slepten his enemy cam and sewe aboue taris in the myddil of whete and wente awei.
 but whanne the erbe was growed and made fruyt thanne the taris apperiden.
 and the seruauntis of the hosebonde man camen and seiden to hym lord whether hast thou not sowun good seed in thi feeld.
 where of thanne hath it taris.
 and he seide to hem an enemy hath do this thing.
 and the seruauntis seiden to him wolt thou that we goon and gaderen hem.
 and he seide nay lest perauenture e in gaderynge taris drawen vp with hem the whete bi the roote.
 suffre e hem bothe to wexe in to repyng tyme.
 and in the tyme of ripe corne y shal seie to the reperis first gadere e to gidere the taris and bynde hem to gidere in knytchis to be brent but gadere e whete in to my berne.
 another parable jhesus puttide forth to hem and seide the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a corn of seneuey which a man took and sewe in his feeld.
 which is the leeste of alle seedis but whanne it hath woxen it is the moste of alle wortis and is maad a tre.
 so that briddis of the eir comen and dwellen in the bowis therof.
 another parable jhesus spac to hem the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to sour dou which a womman took and hidde in thre mesuris of mele til it were alle sowrid.
 jhesus spac alle thes thingis in parablis to the puple and he spac not to hem with out parablis that it schulde be fulfillid that is seid bi the prophete seiynge y shal opene my mouth in parablis.
 y shal telle out hid thingis fro the makyng of the world.
 thanne he lefte the puple and cam in to an hous.
 and hise disciplis camen to him and seiden expowne to vs the parable of taris of the feeld.
 which answeride and seide he that sowith good seed is mannus sone.
 the feeld is the world.
 but the good seed these ben sones of the kyngdom but taris these ben yuele children.
 the enemye that sowith hem is the feend.
 and the ripe corn is the endyng of the world the reperis ben aungels.
 therfor as taris ben gaderid togidere and ben brent in fier so it shal be in the endyng of the world.
 mannus sone shal sende hise aungels and thei schulen gadere fro his rewme alle sclaundris and hem that doon wickidnesse.
 and thei schulen sende hem in to the chymney of fier there shal be weping and betyng to gidere of teeth.
 thanne iuste men schulen schyne as the sunne in the rewme of her fadir.
 he that hath eeris of heryng here he.
 the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to tresour hid in a feld which a man that fyndith hidith.
 and for ioye of it he goith and sillith alle thingis that he hath and bieth thilk feeld.
 eftsoone the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a marchaunt that sechith good margaritis.
 but whanne he hath foundun o precious margarite he wente and selde alle thingis that he hadde and boute it.
 eft the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to a nette cast into the see and that gaderith to gidere of al kynde of fisschis.
 which whanne it was ful thei drowen vp and seten bi the brenke and chesen the goode in to her vessels but the yuel thei kesten out.
 so it schal be in the endyng of the world.
 aungels schulen go out and schulen departe yuel men fro the myddil of iuste men.
 and thei shulen sende hem in to the chymnei of fier.
 ther shal be weping and gryntyng of teeth.
 han e vndirstonde alle these thingis.
 thei seien to hym he.
 he seith to hem therfor euery wise man of lawe in the kyngdom of heuenes is lijk to an hosebonde man that bryngith forth of his tresoure newe thingis and elde.
 and it was doon whanne jhesus hadde endid these parablis he passide fro thennus.
 and he cam in to his cuntrei and taute hem in her synagogis so that thei wondriden and seiden fro whennus this wisdam and vertues camen to this.
 whether is not this the sone of a carpentere.
 whether his modir be not seid marie.
 and hise britheren james and joseph and symount and judas.
 and hise sistris whether thei alle ben not among us.
 fro whennus thanne alle thes thingis camen to this.
 and so thei weren sclaundrid in hym.
 but jhesus seide to hem a profete is not with oute worschip but in his owen cuntre and in his owen hous.
 and he dide not there manye vertues for the vnbileue of hem.
 in that tyme eroude tetrarke prynce of the fourthe part herde the fame of jhesu.
 and seide to hise children this is joon baptist he is rysun fro deeth and therfor vertues worchen in hym.
 for heroude hadde holde joon and bounde hym and puttide hym in to prisoun for herodias the wijf of his brothir.
 for joon seide to him it is not leueful to thee to haue hir.
 and he willynge to sle hym dredde the puple.
 for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
 but in the dai of heroudis birthe the doutir of herodias daunside in the myddil and pleside heroude.
 wherfor with an ooth he bihite to yue to hir what euere thing she hadde axid of hym.
 and she bifor warned of hir modir seide if thou to me here the heed of joon baptist in a disch.
 and the kyng was sorewful but for the ooth and for hem that saten to gidere at the mete he comaundide to be ouun.
 and he sente and bihedide joon in the prisoun.
 and his heed was brout in a dische and it was ouun to the damysel and she bar it to hir modir.
 and hise disciplis camen and token his bodi and birieden it.
 and thei camen and tolden to jhesu.
 and whanne jhesus hadde herd this thing he wente fro thennus in a boot in to desert place bisides.
 and whanne the puple hadde herd thei folewiden hym on her feet fro citees.
 and jhesus ede out and sai a greet puple and hadde reuthe on hem and heelide the sike men of hem.
 but whanne the euentid was com hise disciplis camen to him and seiden the place is desert and the tyme is now passid.
 lat the puple go in to townes to bye hem mete.
 jhesus seide to hem thei han not nede to go.
 yue e hem sumwhat to ete.
 thei answeriden we han not heere but fyue looues and twei fischis.
 and he seide to hem brynge e hem hidur to me.
 and whanne he hadde comaundid the puple to sitte to meete on the heye he took fyue looues and twei fischis and he bihelde in to heuene and blesside and brak and af to hise disciplis.
 and the disciplis auen to the puple.
 and alle eten and weren fulfillid.
 and thei tooken the relifs of brokun gobetis twelue cofynes ful.
 and the noumbre of men that eten was fyue thousynde of men outakun wymmen and lytle children.
 and anoon jhesus compellide the disciplis to go vp in to a boot and go bifor hym ouer the see while he lefte the puple.
 and whanne the puple was left he stiede aloone in to an hil for to preie.
 but whanne the euenyng was come he was there aloone.
 and the boot in the myddel of the see was schoggid with wawis for the wynd was contrarie to hem.
 but in the fourthe wakyng of the nit he cam to hem walkynge aboue the see.
 and thei seynge hym walking on the see weren disturblid and seiden that it is a fantum.
 and for drede thei crieden.
 and anoon jhesus spac to hem and seide haue e trust y am.
 nyle e drede.
 and petre answeride and seide lord if thou art comaunde me to come to thee on the watris.
 and he seide come thou.
 and petre ede doun fro the boot and walkide on the watris to come to jhesu.
 but he si the wynd strong and was aferde.
 and whanne he bigan to drenche he criede and seide lord make me saaf.
 and anoon jhesus helde forth his hoond and took petre and seide to hym thou of litil feith whi hast thou doutid.
 and whanne he hadde stied in to the boot the wynd ceessid.
 and thei that weren in the boot camen and worschipiden hym and seiden verili thou art goddis sone.
 and whanne thei hadden passid ouer the see thei camen in to the loond of genesar.
 and whanne men of that place hadden knowe hym thei senten in to al that cuntre.
 and thei brouten to hym alle that hadden siknesse.
 and thei preieden hym that thei schulden touche the hemme of his clothing.
 and who euere touchiden weren maad saaf.
 thanne the scribis and the farisees camen to hym fro jerusalem and seiden whi breken thi disciplis the tradiciouns of eldere men.
 for thei waisschen not her hondis whanne thei eten breed.
 he answeride and seide to hem whi breken e the maundement of god for oure tradicioun.
 for god seide honoure thi fadir and thi modir and he that cursith fadir or modir die bi deeth.
 but e seien who euer seith to fadir or modir what euere ifte is of me it schal profite to thee.
 and he hath not worschipid his fadir or his modir.
 and e han maad the maundement of god voide for oure tradicioun.
 ypocritis isaie the prophete prophesiede wel of ou and seide this puple honourith me with lippis but her herte is fer fro me.
 and thei worschipen me with outen cause techynge the doctrines and maundementis of men.
 and whanne the puple weren clepid to gidere to hym he seide to hem here e and vndurstonde e.
 that thing that entrith in to the mouth defoulith not a man.
 but that thing that cometh out of the mouth defoulith a man.
 thanne hise disciplis camen and seiden to hym thou knowist that if this word be herd the farisees ben sclaundrid.
 and he answeride and seide eueri plauntyng that my fadir of heuene hath not plauntid shal be drawun vp by the roote.
 suffre e hem.
 thei ben blynde and leederis of blynde men.
 and if a blynd man lede a blynd man bothe fallen doun in to the diche.
 petre answeride and seide to hym expowne to vs this parable.
 and he seide it e ben also with oute vndurstondyng.
 vndurstonden e not that al thing that entrith in to the mouth goith in to the wombe and is sent out in to the goyng awei.
 but tho thingis that comen forth fro the mouth goon out of the herte and tho thingis defoulen a man.
 for of the herte goon out yuele thoutis mansleyngis auowtries fornycaciouns theftis fals witnessyngis blasfemyes.
 thes thingis it ben that defoulen a man.
 but to ete with hondis not waischun defoulith not a man.
 and jhesus ede out fro thennus and wente in to the coostis of tire and sidon.
 and lo.
 a womman of canane ede out of tho coostis and criede and seide to him lord the sone of dauid haue merci on me.
 my douter is yuel traueilid of a feend.
 and he answeride not to hir a word.
 and hise disciplis camen and preieden hym and seiden leue thou hir for she crieth aftir vs.
 he answeride and seide y am not sent but to the scheep of the hous of israel that perischiden.
 and she cam and worschipide hym and seide lord helpe me.
 which answeride and seide it is not good to take the breed of children and caste to houndis.
 and she seide his lord.
 for whelpis eten of the crummes that fallen doun fro the bord of her lordis.
 thanne jhesus answeride and seide to hir a.
 womman thi feith is greet.
 be it doon to thee as thou wolt.
 and hir doutir was helid fro that hour.
 and whanne jhesus hadde passed fro thennus he cam bisidis the see of galilee.
 and he ede vp in to an hil and sat there.
 and myche puple cam to hym and hadden with hem doumbe men and crokid feble and blynde and many other.
 and thei castiden doun hem at hise feet.
 and he helide hem so that the puple wondriden seynge doumbe men spekynge and crokid goynge blynde men seynge.
 and thei magnyfieden god of israel.
 and jhesus whanne hise disciplis weren clepid to gidere seide to hem y haue reuthe of the puple for thei han abiden now thre daies with me and han no thing to ete.
 and y wole not leeue hem fastynge lest thei failen in the weie.
 and the disciplis seien to him wherof thanne so many looues among vs in desert to fulfille so greet a puple.
 and jhesus seide to hem hou many looues han e.
 and thei seiden seuene and a fewe smale fisshis.
 and he comaundide to the puple to sitte to mete on the erthe.
 and he took seuene looues and fyue fischis and dide thankyngis and brak and af to hise disciplis.
 and the disciplis auen to the puple.
 and alle eten and weren fulfillid and thei token that that was left of relifes seuene lepis fulle.
 and thei that eten weren foure thousynde of men with outen litle children and wymmen.
 and whanne he hadde left the puple he wente vp in to a boot and cam in to the coostis of magedan.
 and the farisees and the saducees camen to hym temptynge and preieden hym to schewe hem a tokene fro heuene.
 and he answeride and seide to hem whanne the euentid is comun e seien it schal be clere for heuene is rodi.
 and the morewtid to dai tempest for heuene schyneth heueli.
 thanne e kunne deme the face of heuene but e moun not wite the tokenes of tymes.
 an yuel generacioun and auoutresse sekith a tokene.
 and a tokene schal not be ouun to it but the tokene of jonas the profete.
 and whanne he hadde left hem he wente forth.
 and whanne his disciplis camen ouer the see thei foraten to take looues.
 and he seide to hem biholde e and be war of the soure dow of farisees and saducees.
 and thei thouten among hem and seiden for we han not take looues.
 but jhesus witynge seide to hem what thenken e among ou of litel feith for e han not looues.
 it vndurstonden not e nether han mynde of fyue looues in to fyue thousynde of men and hou many cofyns e token.
 nether of seuene looues in to foure thousynde of men and hou many lepis e token.
 whi vndurstonden e not for y seide not to ou of breed be e war of the sourdow of farisees and of saducees.
 thanne thei vndurstooden that he seide not to be war of sourdow of looues but of the techyng of farisees and saducees.
 and jhesus cam in to the parties of cesarie of filip and axide hise disciplis and seide whom seien men to be mannus sone.
 and thei seiden summe joon baptist.
 othere elie.
 and othere jeremye or oon of the prophetis.
 jhesus seide to hem but whom seien e me to be.
 symount petre answeride and seide thou art crist the sone of god lyuynge.
 jhesus answeride and seide to him blessid art thou symount bariona.
 for fleisch and blood schewide not to thee but my fadir that is in heuenes.
 and y seie to thee that thou art petre and on this stoon y schal bilde my chirche and the atis of helle schulen not haue mit aens it.
 and to thee y shal yue the keies of the kingdom of heuenes.
 and what euer thou shalt bynde on erthe schal be boundun also in heuenes.
 and what euer thou schalt vnbynde on erthe schal be vnbounden also in heuenes.
 thanne he comaundide to hise disciplis that thei schulden seie to no man that he was crist.
 fro that tyme jhesus bigan to schewe to hise disciplis that it bihofte hym go to jerusalem and suffre many thingis of the eldere men and of scribis and princis of prestis.
 and be slayn and the thridde dai to rise aen.
 and petre took hym and bigan to blame him and seide fer be it fro thee lord.
 this thing schal not be to thee.
 and he turnede and seide to petre sathanas go after me.
 thou art a sclaundre to me.
 for thou sauerist not tho thingis that ben of god but tho thingis that ben of men.
 thanne jhesus seide to his disciplis if ony man wole come after me denye he hym silf and take his cros and sue me.
 for he that wole make his lijf saaf shal leese it.
 and he that schal leese his lijf for me schal fynde it.
 for what profitith it to a man if he wynne al the world and suffre peiryng of his soule.
 or what chaunging schal a man yue for his soule.
 for mannes sone schal come in glorie of his fader with his aungels and thanne he schal elde to ech man after his werkis.
 treuli y seie to ou ther ben summe of hem that stonden here whiche schulen not taste deth til thei seen mannus sone comynge in his kyngdom.
 and after sixe daies jhesus took petre and james and joon his brother and ledde hem aside in to an hi hil and was turned in to an othir licnesse bifor hem.
 and his face schone as the sunne.
 and hise clothis weren maad white as snowe.
 and lo.
 moises and elie apperiden to hem and spaken with hym.
 and petre answeride and seide to jhesu lord it is good vs to be here.
 if thou wolt make we here thre tabernaclis.
 to thee oon to moises oon and oon to elye.
 it the while he spak lo.
 a brit cloude ouerschadewide hem.
 and lo.
 a voice out of the cloude that seide this is my dereworth sone in whom y haue wel pleside to me.
 here e hym.
 and the disciplis herden and felden doun on her faces and dredden greetli.
 and jhesus cam and touchide hem and seide to hem rise vp and nyle e drede.
 and thei liften vp her ien and saien no man but jhesu aloone.
 and as thei camen doun of the hille jhesus comaundide to hem and seide seie e to no man the visioun til mannus sone rise aen fro deeth.
 and his disciplis axiden hym and seiden what thanne seien the scribis that it bihoueth that elie come first.
 he answeride and seide to hem elie schal come and he schal restore alle thingis.
 and y seie to ou that elie is nowe comun and thei knewen hym not but thei diden in him what euer thingis thei wolden.
 and so mannus sone schal suffre of hem.
 thanne the disciplis vndurstoden that he seide to hem of joon baptist.
 and whanne he cam to the puple a man cam to hym and felde doun on hise knees bifor hym and seide lord haue merci on my sone.
 for he is lunatike and suffrith yuele for ofte tymes he fallith in to the fier and ofte tymes in to water.
 and y broute hym to thi disciplis and thei myten not heele hym.
 jhesus answeride and seide a.
 thou generacion vnbileueful and weiward.
 hou long schal y be with ou.
 hou long schal y suffre ou.
 brynge e hym hider to me.
 and jhesus blamede hym and the deuel wente out fro hym.
 and the child was heelid fro that our.
 thanne the disciplis camen to jhesu priueli and seiden to hym whi myten not we caste hym out.
 jhesus seith to hem for oure vnbileue.
 treuli y seie to ou if e han feith as a corn of seneueye e schulen seie to this hil passe thou hennus and it schal passe.
 and no thing schal be vnpossible to ou.
 but this kynde is not caste out but bi preiyng and fastyng.
 and whilis thei weren abidynge togidere in galilee jhesus seide to hem mannus sone schal be bitraied in to the hondis of men.
 and thei schulen sle hym and the thridde day he schal rise aen to lijf.
 and thei weren ful sori.
 and whanne thei camen to cafarnaum thei that token tribute camen to petre and seiden to hym oure maister payeth not tribute.
 and he seide his.
 and whanne he was comen in to the hous jhesus cam bifor hym and seide symount what semeth to thee.
 kyngis of erthe of whom taken thei tribute.
 of her sones ether of aliens.
 and he seide of aliens.
 jhesus seide to hym thanne sones ben fre.
 but that we sclaundre hem not go to the see and caste an hook and take thilke fisch that first cometh vp.
 and whanne his mouth is opened thou schalt fynde a stater and yue for thee and for me.
 in that our the disciplis camen to jhesu and seiden who gessist thou is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes.
 and jhesus clepide a litil child and putte hym in the myddil of hem.
 and seide y seie treuthe to ou but e be turned and maad as litle children e schulen not entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
 therfor who euer mekith hym as this litil child he is gretter in the kyngdom of heuenes.
 and he that resseyueth o siche litil child in my name resseyueth me.
 but who so sclaundrith oon of these smale that bileuen in me it spedith to hym that a mylnstoon of assis be hangid in his necke and he be drenchid in the depnesse of the see.
 woo to the world for sclaundris.
 for it is nede that sclaundris come.
 netheles wo to thilke man bi whom a sclaundre cometh.
 and if thin hoond or thi foot sclaundreth thee kitte it of and caste awei fro thee.
 it is betere to thee to entre to lijf feble ethir crokid than hauynge tweyne hoondis or twey feet to be sent in to euerlastynge fier.
 and if thin ie sclaundre thee pulle it out and caste awei fro thee.
 it is betere to thee with oon ie to entre in to lijf thanne hauynge tweyn ien to be sent in to the fier of helle.
 se e that e dispise not oon of these litle.
 for y seie to ou that the aungels of hem in heuenes seen euermore the face of my fadir that is in heuenes.
 for mannus sone cam to saue that thing that perischide.
 what semeth to ou.
 if ther weren to sum man an hundrid scheep and oon of hem hath errid whethir he schal not leeue nynti and nyne in desert and schal go to seche that that erride.
 and if it falle that he fynde it treuli y seie to ou that he schal haue ioye theron more than on nynti and nyne that erriden not.
 so it is not the wille bifor oure fadir that is in heuenes that oon of these litle perische.
 but if thi brother synneth aens thee go thou and repreue hym bitwixe thee and hym aloone.
 if he herith thee thou hast wonnun thi brother.
 and if he herith thee not take with thee oon or tweyne that euery word stonde in the mouth of tweyne or thre witnessis.
 and if he herith not hem seie thou to the chirche.
 but if he herith not the chirche be he as an hethen and a pupplican to thee.
 y seie to ou treuli what euer thingis e bynden on erthe tho schulen be boundun also in heuene.
 and what euer thingis e vnbynden on erthe tho schulen be vnboundun also in heuene.
 eftsoone y seie to ou that if tweyne of ou consenten on the erthe of euery thing what euer thei axen it schal be don to hem of my fadir that is in heuenes.
 for where tweyne or thre ben gaderid in my name there y am in the myddil of hem.
 thanne petre cam to hym and seide lord how ofte schal my brother synne aens me and y schal foryue hym.
 whether til seuen tymes.
 jhesus seith to hym y seie not to thee til seuene sithis.
 but til seuenti sithis seuene sithis.
 therfor the kyngdom of heuenes is licned to a kyng that wolde rekyn with hise seruauntis.
 and whanne he bigan to rekene oon that oute ten thousynde talentis was brout to hym.
 and whanne he hadde not wherof to elde his lord comaundide hym to be seld and his wijf and children and alle thingis that he hadde and to be paied.
 but thilke seruaunt felde doun and preiede hym and seide haue pacience in me and y schal elde to thee alle thingis.
 and the lord hadde merci on that seruaunt and suffride hym to go and foraf to hym the dette.
 but thilke seruaunt ede out and foonde oon of his euen seruauntis that oute hym an hundrid pens.
 and he helde hym and stranglide hym and seide elde that that thou owest.
 and his euen seruaunt felle doun and preyede hym and seide haue pacience in me and y schal quyte alle thingis to thee.
 but he wolde not.
 but wente out and putte hym in to prisoun til he paiede al the dette.
 and hise euen seruauntis seynge the thingis that weren don soreweden greetli.
 and thei camen and telden to her lord alle the thingis that weren don.
 thanne his lord clepide hym and seide to hym wickid seruaunt y foraf to thee al the dette for thou preiedist me.
 therfor whether it bihouede not also thee to haue merci on thin euen seruaunt as y hadde merci on thee.
 and his lord was wroth and took hym to turmentouris til he paiede al the dette.
 so my fadir of heuene schal do to ou if e foryuen not euery man to his brother of oure hertes.
 and it was don whanne jhesus hadde endid these wordis he passide fro galilee and cam in to the coostis of judee ouer jordan.
 and myche puple suede him and he heelide hem there.
 and farisees camen to him temptynge him and seiden whether it be leueful to a man to leeue his wijf for ony cause.
 which answeride and seide to hem han e not red for he that made men at the bigynnyng made hem male and female.
 and he seide for this thing a man schal leeue fadir and modir and he schal draw to his wijf.
 and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
 and so thei ben not now tweyne but o fleisch.
 therfor a man departe not that thing that god hath ioyned.
 thei seien to hym what thanne comaundide moises to yue a libel of forsakyng and to leeue of.
 and he seide to hem for moises for the hardnesse of oure herte suffride ou leeue oure wyues.
 but fro the bigynnyng it was not so.
 and y seie to ou that who euer leeueth his wijf but for fornycacioun and weddith another doith letcherie.
 and he that weddith the forsakun wijf doith letcherie.
 his disciplis seien to him if the cause of a man with a wijf is so it spedith not to be weddid.
 and he seide to hem not alle men taken this word.
 but to whiche it is ouun.
 for ther ben geldingis whiche ben thus born of the modris wombe.
 and ther ben geldyngis that ben maad of men.
 and there ben geldyngis that han geldid hem silf for the kyngdom of heuenes.
 he that may take take he.
 thanne litle children weren broute to hym that he schulde putte hondis to hem and preie.
 and the disciplis blamyden hem.
 but jhesus seide to hem suffre e that litle children come to me and nyle e forbede hem.
 for of siche is the kyngdom of heuenes.
 and whanne he hadde put to hem hondis he wente fro thennus.
 and lo.
 oon cam and seide to hym good maister what good schal y do that y haue euerlastynge lijf.
 which seith to hym what axist thou me of good thing.
 there is o good god.
 but if thou wolt entre to lijf kepe the comaundementis.
 he seith to hym whiche.
 and jhesus seide thou schalt not do mansleying thou schalt not do auowtrie thou schalt not do thefte thou schalt not seie fals witnessying.
 worschipe thi fadir and thi modir and thou schalt loue thi neibore as thi silf.
 the onge man seith to hym y haue kept alle these thingis fro my outhe what it failith to me.
 jhesus seith to hym if thou wolt be perfite go and sille alle thingis that thou hast and yue to pore men and thou schalt haue tresoure in heuene.
 and come and sue me.
 and whanne the ong man hadde herd these wordis he wente awei sorewful for he hadde many possessiouns.
 and jhesus seide to hise disciplis y seie to ou treuthe for a riche man of hard schal entre in to the kyngdom of heuenes.
 and eftsoone y seie to ou it is liter a camel to passe thorou a needlis ie thanne a riche man to entre in to the kyngdom of heuens.
 whanne these thingis weren herd the disciplis wondriden greetli and seiden who thanne may be saaf.
 jhesus bihelde and seide to hem anentis men this thing is impossible.
 but anentis god alle thingis ben possible.
 thanne petre answeride and seide to hym lo.
 we han forsake alle thingis and we han suede thee.
 what thanne schal be to vs.
 jhesus seide to hem truli i seie to ou that e that han forsake alle thingis and han sued me in the regeneracioun whanne mannus sone schal sitte in the sete of his maieste e schulen sitte on twelue setis demynge the twelue kynredis of israel.
 and euery man that forsakith hous britheren or sistren fadir or modir wijf ethir children or feeldis for my name he schal take an hundrid foold and schal welde euerlastynge lijf.
 but manye schulen be the firste the laste and the laste the firste.
 the kyngdom of heuenes is lijc to an housbonde man that wente out first bi the morewe to hire werk men in to his vyneerd.
 and whanne the couenaunt was maad with werk men of a peny for the dai he sente hem in to his vyneerd.
 and he ede out aboute the thridde our and say othere stondynge idel in the chepyng.
 and he seide to hem go e also in to myn vynerd and that that schal be ritful y schal yue to ou.
 and thei wenten forth.
 eftsoones he wente out aboute the sixte our and the nynthe and dide in lijk maner.
 but aboute the elleuenthe our he wente out and foond other stondynge.
 and he seide to hem what stonden e idel here al dai.
 thei seien to him for no man hath hirid vs.
 he seith to hem go e also in to my vyneerd.
 and whanne euenyng was comun the lord of the vyneerd seith to his procuratoure clepe the werk men and elde to hem her hire and bigynne thou at the laste til to the firste.
 and so whanne thei weren comun that camen aboute the elleuenthe our also thei token eueryche of hem a peny.
 but the firste camen and demeden that thei schulden take more but thei token ech oon bi hem silf a peny.
 and in the takyng grutchiden aens the hosebonde man and seiden these laste wrouten oon our and thou hast maad hem euen to vs that han born the charge of the dai and heete.
 and he answeride to oon of hem and seide freend y do thee noon wrong.
 whether thou hast not acordid with me for a peny.
 take thou that that is thin and go.
 for y wole yue to this laste man as to thee.
 whether it is not leueful to me to do that that y wole.
 whether thin ie is wickid for y am good.
 so the laste schulen be the firste and the firste the laste.
 for many ben clepid but fewe ben chosun.
 and jhesus wente vp to jerusalem and took hise twelue disciplis in priuetee and seide to hem lo.
 we goon vp to jerusalem and mannus sone schal be bitakun to princis of prestis and scribis.
 and thei schulen condempne him to deeth.
 and thei schulen bitake hym to hethene men for to be scorned and scourgid and crucified.
 and the thridde day he schal rise aen to lijf.
 thanne the modir of the sones of zebedee cam to hym with hir sones onourynge and axynge sum thing of hym.
 and he seide to hir what wolt thou.
 she seith to hym seie that thes tweyne my sones sitte oon at thi rithalf and oon at thi lefthalf in thi kyngdom.
 jhesus answeride and seide e witen not what e axen.
 moun e drynke the cuppe which y schal drynke.
 thei seien to hym we moun.
 he seith to hem e schulen drinke my cuppe.
 but to sitte at my rithalf or lefthalf it is not myn to yue to ou.
 but to whiche it is maad redi of my fadir.
 and the ten herynge hadden indignacioun of the twei britheren.
 but jhesus clepide hem to hym and seide e witen that princis of hethene men ben lordis of hem and thei that ben gretter vsen power on hem.
 it schal not be so among ou.
 but who euer wole be maad gretter among ou be he oure mynystre.
 and who euer among ou wole be the firste he schal be oure seruaunt.
 as mannus sone cam not to be seruyd but to serue and to yue his lijf redempcioun for manye.
 and whanne thei eden out of jerico miche puple suede him.
 and lo.
 twei blynde men saten bisydis the weie and herden that jhesus passide.
 and thei crieden and seiden lord the sone of dauid haue merci on vs.
 and the puple blamede hem that thei schulden be stille.
 and thei crieden the more and seiden lord the sone of dauid haue merci on vs.
 and jhesus stood and clepide hem and seide what wolen e that y do to ou.
 thei seien to him lord that oure ien be opened.
 and jhesus hadde merci on hem and touchide her ien.
 and anoon thei sayen and sueden him.
 and whanne jhesus cam ny to jerusalem and cam to bethfage at the mount of olyuete thanne sente he his twei disciplis and seide to hem go e in to the castel that is aens ou and anoon e schulen fynde an asse tied and a colt with hir.
 vntien e and brynge to me.
 and if ony man seie to ou ony thing seie e that the lord hath nede to hem.
 and anoon he schal leeue hem.
 al this was doon that that thing schulde be fulfillid that was seid bi the prophete seiynge seie e to the douter of syon lo.
 thi kyng cometh to thee meke sittynge on an asse and a fole of an asse vnder ok.
 and the disciplis eden and diden as jhesus comaundide hem.
 and thei brouten an asse and the fole and leiden her clothis on hem and maden hym sitte aboue.
 and ful myche puple strewiden her clothis in the weie.
 othere kittiden braunchis of trees and strewiden in the weie.
 and the puple that wente bifore and that sueden crieden and seiden osanna to the sone of dauid.
 blessid is he that cometh in the name of the lord.
 osanna in hi thingis.
 and whanne he was entrid in to jerusalem al the citee was stirid and seide who is this.
 but the puple seide this is jhesus the prophete of nazareth of galilee.
 and jhesus entride in to the temple of god and castide out of the temple alle that bouten and solden.
 and he turnede vpsedoun the bordis of chaungeris and the chayeris of men that solden culueris.
 and he seith to hem it is writun myn hous schal be clepid an hous of preier.
 but e han maad it a denne of theues.
 and blynde and crokid camen to hym in the temple and he heelide hem.
 but the princis of prestis and scribis seynge the merueilouse thingis that he dide and children criynge in the temple and seiynge osanna to the sone of dauid hadden indignacioun and seiden to hym herist thou what these seien.
 and jhesus seide to hem he.
 whether e han neuer redde that of the mouth of onge children and of soukynge childryn thou hast maad perfit heriyng.
 and whanne he hadde left hem he wente forth out of the citee in to bethanye.
 and there he dwelte and taute hem of the kyngdom of god.
 but on the morowe he turnynge aen in to the citee hungride.
 and he saye a fige tree bisidis the weie and cam to it and foond no thing ther ynne but leeues oneli.
 and he seide to it neuer fruyt come forth of thee in to with outen eende and anoon the fige tre was dried vp.
 and disciplis sawen and wondriden seiynge hou anoon it driede.
 and jhesus answeride and seide to hem treuli y seie to ou if e haue feith and douten not not oonli e schulen do of the fige tree but also if e seyn to this hil take and caste thee in to the see it schal be don so.
 and alle thingis what euere e bileuynge schulen axe in preyer e schulen take.
 and whanne he cam in to the temple the princis of prestis and elder men of the puple camen to hym that taute and seiden in what power doist thou these thingis.
 and who af thee this power.
 jhesus answeride and seide to hem and y schal axe ou o word the which if e tellen me y schal seie to ou in what power y do these thingis.
 of whennys was the baptym of joon.
 of heuene or of men.
 and thei thouten with ynne hem silf seiynge if we seien of heuene he schal seie to vs whi thanne bileuen e not to hym.
 if we seien of men we dreden the puple for alle hadden joon as a prophete.
 and thei answeriden to jhesu and seiden we witen not.
 and he seide to hem nether y seie to ou in what power y do these thingis.
 but what semeth to ou.
 a man hadde twey sones.
 and he cam to the firste and seide sone go worche this dai in my vyneerd.
 and he answeride and seide y nyle.
 but afterward he forthoute and wente forth.
 but he cam to the tother and seide on lijk maner.
 and he answeride and seide lord y go.
 and he wente not.
 who of the tweyne dide the fadris wille.
 thei seien to hym the firste.
 jhesus seith to hem treuli y seie to ou for pupplicans and hooris schulen go bifor ou in to the kyngdom of god.
 for joon cam to ou in the weie of ritwisnesse and e bileueden not to him.
 but pupplicans and hooris bileueden to hym.
 but e sayn and hadden no forthenkyng aftir that e bileueden to hym.
 here e another parable.
 there was an hosebonde man that plauntide a vynerd and heggide it aboute and dalfe a presour ther ynne and bildide a tour and hiride it to erthe tilieris and wente fer in pilgrimage.
 but whanne the tyme of fruytis neiede he sente his seruauntis to the erthe tilieris to take fruytis of it.
 and the erthetilieris token his seruauntis and beeten the toon thei slowen another and thei stonyden another.
 eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis mo than the firste and in lijk maner thei diden to hem.
 and at the laste he sente his sone to hem and seide thei schulen drede my sone.
 but the erthe tilieris seynge the sone seiden with ynne hem silf this is the eire.
 come e sle we hym and we schulen haue his eritage.
 and thei token and castiden hym out of the vynerd and slowen hym.
 therfor whanne the lord of the vyneerd schal come what schal he do to thilke erthe tilieris.
 thei seien to hym he schal leese yuele the yuele men and he schal sette to hire his vyneerd to othere erthetilieris whyche schulen elde to hym fruyt in her tymes.
 jhesus seith to hem redden e neuer in scripturis the stoon which bilderis repreueden this is maad in to the heed of the corner.
 of the lord this thing is don and it is merueilous bifor oure ien.
 therfor y seie to ou that the kyngdom of god schal be takun fro ou and shal be ouun to a folc doynge fruytis of it.
 and he that schal falle on this stoon schal be brokun.
 but on whom it schal falle it schal al tobrise hym.
 and whanne the princes of prestis and farisees hadden herd hise parablis thei knewen that he seide of hem.
 and thei souten to holde hym but thei dredden the puple for thei hadden hym as a prophete.
 and jhesus answeride and spak eftsoone in parablis to hem and seide the kyngdom of heuenes is maad lijk to a kyng that made weddyngis to his sone.
 and he sente hise seruauntis for to clepe men that weren bode to the weddyngis and thei wolden not come.
 eftsoone he sente othere seruauntis and seide seie e to the men that ben bode to the feeste lo.
 y haue maad redi my meete my bolis and my volatilis ben slayn and alle thingis ben redy.
 come e to the weddyngis.
 but thei dispisiden and wenten forth oon in to his toun anothir to his marchaundise.
 but othere helden his seruauntis and turmentiden hem and slowen.
 but the kyng whanne he hadde herd was wroth.
 and he sente hise oostis and he distruyede tho manquelleris and brente her citee.
 thanne he seide to hise seruauntis the weddyngis ben redi but thei that weren clepid to the feeste weren not worthi.
 therfor go e to the endis of weies and whom euere e fynden clepe e to the weddyngis.
 and hise seruauntis eden out in to weies and gadriden togider alle that thei founden good and yuele.
 and the bridale was fulfillid with men sittynge at the mete.
 and the kyng entride to se men sittynge at the mete.
 and he sie there a man not clothid with bride cloth.
 and he seide to hym freend hou entridist thou hidir with out bride clothis.
 and he was doumbe.
 thanne the kyng bad hise mynystris bynde hym bothe hondis and feet and sende e him in to vtmer derknessis.
 there schal be wepyng and grentyng of teeth.
 for many ben clepid but fewe ben chosun.
 thanne farisees eden awei and token a counsel to take jhesu in word.
 and thei senden to hym her disciplis with erodians and seien maister we witen that thou art sothefast and thou techist in treuthe the weie of god and thou chargist not of ony man for thou biholdist not the persoone of men.
 therfor seie to vs what it seemeth to thee.
 is it leueful that tribute be ouun to the emperoure ether nay.
 and whanne jhesus hadde knowe the wickidnesse of hem he seide ypocritis what tempten e me.
 schewe e to me the prynte of the money.
 and thei brouten to hym a peny.
 and jhesus seide to hem whos is this ymage and the writyng aboue.
 thei seien to hym the emperouris.
 thanne he seide to hem therfor elde e to the emperoure tho thingis that ben the emperouris and to god tho thingis that ben of god.
 and thei herden and wondriden.
 and thei leften hym and wenten awey.
 in that dai saduceis that seien there is no risyng aen to lijf camen to hym and axiden him and seiden mayster moises seide if ony man is deed not hauynge a sone that his brother wedde his wijf and reise seed to his brothir.
 and seuen britheren weren at vs.
 and the firste weddide a wijf and is deed.
 and he hadde no seed and lefte his wijf to his brother.
 also the secounde and the thridde til to the seuenthe.
 but the laste of alle the woman is deed.
 also in the risyng aen to lijf whos wijf of the seuene schal sche be.
 for alle hadden hir.
 jhesus answeride and seide to hem e erren and e knowen not scripturis ne the vertu of god.
 for in the rysyng aen to lijf nether thei schulen wedde nethir schulen be weddid.
 but thei ben as the aungels of god in heuene.
 and of the risyng aen of deed men han e not red that is seid of the lord that seith to ou y am god of abraham and god of ysaac and god of jacob.
 he is not god of deede men but of lyuynge men.
 and the puple herynge wondriden in his techynge.
 and fariseis herden that he hadde put silence to saduceis and camen togidere.
 and oon of hem a techere of the lawe axide jhesu and temptide him maistir which is a greet maundement in the lawe.
 jhesus seide to him thou schalt loue thi lord god of al thin herte and in al thi soule and in al thi mynde.
 this is the firste and the moste maundement.
 and the secounde is lijk to this.
 thou schalt loue thi neiebore as thi silf.
 in these twey maundementis hangith al the lawe and the profetis.
 and whanne the farisees weren gederid togidere jhesus axide hem and seide what semeth to ou of crist whos sone is he.
 thei seien to hym of dauid.
 he seith to hem hou thanne dauid in spirit clepith hym lord and seith the lord seide to my lord sitte on my rithalf til y putte thin enemyes a stool of thi feet.
 thanne if dauid clepith hym lord hou is he his sone.
 and no man mite answere a word to hym nethir ony man was hardi fro that day to axe hym more.
 thanne jhesus spac to the puple and to hise disciplis and seide on the chayere of moises scribis and farisees han sete.
 therfor kepe e and do e alle thingis what euer thingis thei seien to you.
 but nyle e do aftir her werkis.
 for thei seien and don not.
 and thei bynden greuouse chargis and that moun not be borun and putten on schuldris of men.

 and thei louen the first sittyng placis in soperis and the first chaieris in synagogis.

 he that is grettest among ou schal be oure mynystre.

 and who euer swerith in the auter it is no thing.
 but he that swerith in the ifte that is on the auter owith.

 therfor he that swerith in the auter swerith in it and in alle thingis that ben ther on.
 and he that swerith in the temple swerith in it and in hym that dwellith in the temple.
 and he that swerith in heuene swerith in the trone of god and in hym that sittith ther on.
 wo to ou scribis and farisees ypocritis that tithen mynte anete and cummyn and han left tho thingis that ben of more charge of the lawe doom and merci and feith.
 and it bihofte to do these thingis and not to leeue tho.

 and so e ben in witnessyng to ou silf that e ben the sones of hem that slowen the prophetis.
 and fulfille e the mesure of oure fadris.
 e eddris and eddris briddis hou schulen e fle fro the doom of helle.
 therfor lo.
 y sende to ou profetis and wise men and scribis.
 and of hem e schulen sle and crucifie and of hem e schulen scourge in oure sinagogis and schulen pursue fro cite in to citee.
 that al the iust blood come on ou that was sched on the erthe fro the blood of iust abel to the blood of zacarie the sone of barachie whom e slowen bitwixe the temple and the auter.
 treuli y seie to ou alle these thingis schulen come on this generacioun.
 jerusalem jerusalem that sleest prophetis and stoonest hem that ben sent to thee hou ofte wolde y gadere togidere thi children as an henne gaderith togidir her chikenes vndir hir wengis and thou woldist not.
 oure hous schal be left to ou desert.
 and y seie to ou e schulen not se me fro hennus forth til e seien blessid is he that cometh in the name of the lord.
 and jhesus wente out of the temple.
 and his disciplis camen to hym to schewe hym the bildyngis of the temple.
 but he answeride and seide to hem seen e alle these thingis.
 treuli y seie to ou a stoon schal not be left here on a stoon that ne it schal be destried.
 and whanne he satte on the hille of olyuete hise disciplis camen to hym priueli and seiden seie vs whanne these thingis schulen be and what token of thi comyng and of the ending of the world.
 and jhesus answeride and seide to hem loke e that no man disseyue ou.
 for many schulen come in my name and schulen seie y am crist.
 and thei schulen disseyue manye.
 for e schulen here batels and opyniouns of batels.
 se e that e be not disturblid.
 for it byhoueth these thingis to be don but not it is the ende.
 folk schal rise togidere aens folc and rewme aens rewme and pestilences and hungris and the erthemouyngis schulen be bi placis.
 and alle these ben bigynnyngis of sorewes.
 thanne men schulen bitake ou in to tribulacion and schulen sle ou and e schulen be in hate to alle folk for my name.
 and thanne many schulen be sclaundrid and bitraye ech other and thei schulen hate ech other.
 and many false prophetis schulen rise and disseyue manye.
 and for wickidnesse schal be plenteuouse the charite of manye schal wexe coold.
 but he that schal dwelle stable in to the ende schal be saaf.
 and this gospel of the kyngdom schal be prechid in al the world in witnessyng to al folc.
 and thanne the ende schal come.
 therfor whanne e se the abhomynacioun of discomfort that is seid of danyel the prophete stondynge in the hooli place.
 he that redith vndirstonde he.
 thanne thei that ben in judee fle to the mounteyns.
 and he that is in the hous roof come not doun to take ony thing of his hous.
 and he that is in the feeld turne not aen to take his coote.
 but wo to hem that ben with child and nurischen in tho daies.
 preye e that oure fleyng be not maad in wynter or in the saboth.
 for thanne schal be greet tribulacioun what maner was not fro the bigynnyng of the world to now nether schal be maad.
 and but tho daies hadden be abreggide ech flesch schulde not be maad saaf.
 but tho daies schulen be maad schort for the chosun men.
 thanne if ony man seie to ou lo.
 here is crist or there nyle e bileue.
 for false cristis and false prophetis schulen rise and thei schulen yue grete tokenes and wondrys.
 so that also the chosun be led in to erroure if it may be done.
 y haue bifor seid to ou.
 therfor if thei seie to ou lo.
 he is in desert nyle e go out.
 in priuey placis nyle e trowe.
 for as leit goith out fro the eest and apperith in to the weste so schal be also the coming of mannus sone.
 where euer the bodi schal be also the eglis schulen be gaderid thidur.
 and anoon after the tribulacioun of tho daies the sunne schal be maad derk and the moone schal not yue hir lit and the sterris schulen falle fro heuene and the vertues of heuenes schulen be moued.
 and thanne the tokene of mannus sone schal appere in heuene and thanne alle kynredis of the erthe schulen weile.
 and thei schulen see mannus sone comynge in the cloudis of heuene with miche vertu and maieste.
 and he schal sende hise aungels with a trumpe and a greet vois.
 and thei schulen gedere hise chosun fro foure wyndis fro the hiest thingis of heuenes to the endis of hem.
 and lerne e the parable of a fige tre.
 whanne his braunche is now tendir and the leeues ben sprongun e witen that somer is ny.
 so and e whanne e seen alle these thingis wite e that it is ny in the atis.
 treuli y seie to ou for this generacioun schal not passe til alle thingis be don.
 heuene and erthe schulen passe but my wordis schulen not passe.
 but of thilke dai and our no man wote nethir aungels of heuenes but the fadir aloone.
 but as it was in the daies of noe so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
 for as in the daies bifore the greet flood thei weren etynge and drynkynge weddynge and takynge to weddyng to that dai that noe entride in to the schippe.
 and thei knewen not til the greet flood cam and took alle men so schal be the comyng of mannus sone.
 thanne tweyne schulen be in o feeld oon schal be takun and another left.
 twey wymmen schulen be gryndynge in o queerne oon schal be takun and the tother left.
 tweyn in a bedde the toon schal be takun and the tother left.
 therfor wake e for e witen not in what our the lord schal come.
 but wite e this that if the hosebonde man wiste in what our the thefe were to come certis he wolde wake and suffre not his hous to be vndurmyned.
 and therfor be e redi for in what our e gessen not mannus sone schal come.
 who gessist thou is a trewe seruaunt and prudent whom his lord ordeyned on his meynee to yue hem mete in tyme.
 blessed is that seruaunt whom his lord whanne he schal come schal fynde so doynge.
 treuli y seye to ou for on alle his goodis he schal ordeyne hym.
 but if thilke yuel seruaunt seie in his herte my lord tarieth to come and bigynneth to smyte hise euen seruauntis and ete and drynke with drunken men.
 the lord of that seruaunt schal come in the dai which he hopith not and in the our that he knowith not and schal departe hym and putte his part with ypocritis.
 there schal be wepyng and gryntyng of teeth.
 thanne the kyngdoom of heuenes schal be lijk to ten virgyns whiche token her laumpis and wenten out aens the hosebonde and the wijf.
 and fyue of hem weren foolis and fyue prudent.
 but the fyue foolis token her laumpis and token not oile with hem.
 but the prudent token oile in her vessels with the laumpis.
 and whilis the hosebonde tariede alle thei nappiden and slepten.
 but at mydnyt a cry was maad lo.
 the spouse cometh go e oute to mete with him.
 thanne alle tho virgyns risen vp and araieden her laumpis.
 and the foolis seiden to the wise yue e to vs of oure oile for oure laumpis ben quenchid.
 the prudent answeriden and seiden lest perauenture it suffice not to vs and to ou go e rather to men that sellen and bie to ou.
 and while thei wenten for to bie the spouse cam.
 and tho that weren redi entreden with him to the weddyngis.
 and the ate was schit.
 and at the last the othere virgyns camen and seiden lord lord opene to vs.
 and he answeride and seide treuli y seie to ou y knowe ou not.
 therfor wake e for e witen not the dai ne the our.
 for as a man that goith in pilgrimage clepide hise seruauntis and bitook to hem hise goodis.
 and to oon he af fyue talentis and to another tweyne and to another oon to ech after his owne vertu.
 and wente forth anoon.
 and he that hadde fyue besauntis wente forth and wroute in hem and wan othere fyue.
 also and he that hadde takun tweyne wan othere tweyne.
 but he that hadde takun oon ede forth and dalf in to the erthe and hidde the money of his lord.
 but after long tyme the lord of tho seruauntis cam and rekenede with hem.
 and he that hadde takun fyue besauntis cam and broute othere fyue and seide lord thou bytokist to me fyue besauntis loo.
 y haue getun aboue fyue othere.
 his lord seide to hym wel be thou good seruaunt and feithful.
 for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe y schal ordeyne thee on manye thingis.
 entre thou in to the ioye of thi lord.
 and he that hadde takun twey talentis cam and seide lord thou bitokist to me twey besauntis.
 y haue wonnen ouer othir tweyne.
 his lord seide to him wel be thou good seruaunt and trewe.
 for on fewe thingis thou hast be trewe y schal ordeyne thee on many thingis.
 entre thou in to the ioie of thi lord.
 but he that hadde takun o besaunt cam and seide lord y woot that thou art an hard man.
 thou repist where thou hast not sowe and thou gederist togidere where thou hast not spred abrood.
 and y dredynge wente and hidde thi besaunt in the erthe.
 thou hast that that is thin.
 his lord answeride and seide to hym yuel seruaunt and slowe wistist thou that y repe where y sewe not and gadir to gidere where y spredde not abrood.
 therfor it bihofte thee to bitake my money to chaungeris that whanne y cam y schulde resseyue that that is myn with vsuris.
 therfor take awei fro hym the besaunt and yue e to hym that hath ten besauntis.
 for to euery man that hath me schal yue and he schal encreese.
 but fro hym that hath not also that that hym semeth to haue schal be taken awey fro him.
 and caste e out the vnprofitable seruaunt in to vtmer derknessis.
 ther schal be wepyng and gryntyng of teeth.
 whanne mannus sone schal come in his maieste and alle hise aungels with hym thanne he schal sitte on the sege of his maieste.
 and alle folkis schulen be gaderid bifor hym and he schal departe hem atwynne as a scheeperde departith scheep from kidis.
 and he schal sette the scheep on his rithalf and the kidis on the lefthalf.
 thanne the kyng schal seie to hem that schulen be on his rithalf come e the blessid of my fadir take e in possessioun the kyngdoom maad redi to ou fro the makyng of the world.
 for y hungride and e auen me to ete.
 y thristide and e auen me to drynke.
 y was herboreles and e herboriden me.
 nakid and e hiliden me.
 sijk and e visitiden me.
 y was in prisoun and e camen to me.
 thanne iust men schulen answere to hym and seie lord whanne sien we thee hungry and we fedden thee.
 thristi and we auen to thee drynk.
 and whanne sayn we thee herborles and we herboreden thee.
 or nakid and we hiliden thee.
 or whanne sayn we thee sijk or in prisoun and we camen to thee.
 and the kyng answerynge schal seie to hem treuli y seie to ou as longe as e diden to oon of these my leeste britheren e diden to me.
 thanne the kyng schal seie also to hem that schulen be on his lefthalf departe fro me e cursid in to euerlastynge fijr that is maad redi to the deuel and hise aungels.
 for y hungride and e auen not me to ete.
 y thristide and e auen not me to drynke.
 y was herborles and e herberden not me.

 sijk and in prisoun and e visitiden not me.
 thanne and thei schulen answere to hym and schulen seie lord whanne sayn we thee hungrynge or thristynge or herboreles or nakid or sijk or in prisoun and we serueden not to thee.
 thanne he schal answere to hem and seie treuli y seie to ou hou longe e diden not to oon of these leeste nether e diden to me.
 and these schulen goo in to euerlastynge turment.
 but the iust men schulen go in to euerlastynge lijf.
 and it was doon whanne jhesus hadde endid alle these wordis he seide to hise disciplis e witen that aftir twei daies pask schal be maad and mannus sone schal be bitakun to be crucified.
 than the princes of prestis and the elder men of the puple were gaderid in to the halle of the prince of prestis that was seid cayfas and maden a counsel to holde jhesu with gile and sle him.
 but thei seiden not in the haliday lest perauenture noyse were maad in the puple.
 and whanne jhesus was in betanye in the hous of symount leprous a womman that hadde a box of alabastre of precious oynement cam to hym and schedde out on the heed of hym restynge.
 and disciplis seynge hadden dedeyn and seiden wherto this loss.
 for it myte be seld for myche and be ouun to pore men.
 but jhesus knewe and seide to hem what ben e heuy to this womman.
 for sche hath wrout in me a good werk.
 for e schulen euere haue pore men with ou but e schulen not algatis haue me.
 this womman sendynge this oynement in to my bodi dide to birie me.
 treuli y seie to ou where euer this gospel schal be prechid in al the world it schal be seid that sche dide this in mynde of hym.
 thanne oon of the twelue that was clepid judas scarioth wente forth to the princis of prestis and seide to hem what wolen e yue to me and y schal bitake hym to ou.
 and thei ordeyneden to hym thretti pans of siluer.
 and fro that tyme he soute oportunyte to bitraye hym.
 and in the firste dai of therf looues the disciplis camen to jhesu and seiden where wolt thou we make redi to thee to ete paske.
 jhesus seide go e into the citee to sum man and seie to hym the maistir seith my tyme is ny.
 at thee y make paske with my disciplis.
 and the disciplis diden as jhesus comaundide to hem.
 and thei maden the paske redi.
 and whanne euentid was come he sat to mete with hise twelue disciplis.
 and he seide to hem as thei eten treuli y seie to ou that oon of ou schal bitraye me.
 and thei ful sori bigunnen ech bi hym silf to seie lord whether y am.
 and he answeride and seide he that puttith with me his hoond in the plater schal bitraye me.
 forsothe mannus sone goith as it is writun of hym.
 but wo to that man bi whom mannus sone schal be bitrayed.
 it were good to hym if that man hadde not be borun.

 and whanne he hadde cast forth the siluer in the temple he passide forth and ede and hongide hym silf with a snare.
 and the princis of prestis token the siluer and seide it is not leueful to putte it in to the treserie for it is the prijs of blood.
 and whanne thei hadden take counsel thei bouten with it a feeld of a potter in to biryyng of pilgrymys.
 herfor thilke feeld is clepid acheldemac that is a feeld of blood in to this dai.

 and while he sat for domesman his wijf sente to hym and seide no thing to thee and to that iust man.
 for y haue suffrid this dai many thingis for hym bi a visioun.
 forsothe the prince of prestis and the eldere men counseiliden the puple that thei schulden axe barabas but thei schulden distrye jhesu.
 but the iustice answeride and seide to hem whom of the tweyn wolen e that be delyuerit to ou.
 and thei seiden barabas.

 thanne he deliuerede to hem barabas but he took to hem jhesu scourgid to be crucified.
 thanne knytis of the iustice token jhesu in the moot halle and gadriden to hym al the cumpeny of knytis.
 and thei vnclothiden hym and diden aboute hym a reed mantil.
 and thei foldiden a coroun of thornes and putten on his heed and a rehed in his rit hoond.
 and thei kneliden bifore hym and scornyden hym and seiden heil kyng of jewis.
 and thei speten on hym and tooken a rehed and smoot his heed.
 and aftir that thei hadden scorned him thei vnclothiden hym of the mantil and thei clothiden hym with hise clothis and ledden hym to crucifien hym.
 and as thei eden out thei founden a man of cirenen comynge fro the toun symont bi name.
 thei constreyneden hym to take his cross.
 and thei camen in to a place that is clepid golgatha that is the place of caluarie.
 and thei auen hym to drynke wyne meynd with galle.
 and whanne he hadde tastid he wolde not drynke.
 and aftir that thei hadden crucified hym thei departiden his clothis and kesten lotte to fulfille that is seid bi the prophete seiynge thei partiden to hem my clothis and on my clooth thei kesten lott.
 and thei seten and kepten him.
 and setten aboue his heed his cause writun this is jhesu of nazareth kyng of jewis.
 thanne twey theues weren crucified with hym oon on the rithalf and oon on the lefthalf.
 and men that passiden forth blasfemeden hym mouynge her heedis and seiynge vath to thee that distriest the temple of god and in the thridde dai bildist it aen.
 saue thou thi silf.
 if thou art the sone of god come doun of the cross.
 also and princis of prestis scornynge with scribis and elder men seiden he made othere men saaf he may not make hym silf saaf.
 if he is kyng of israel come he now doun fro the crosse and we bileuen to hym.
 he tristide in god.
 delyuer he hym now if he wole.
 for he seide that y am goddis sone.
 and the theues that weren crucified with hym vpbreididen hym of the same thing.
 but fro the sixte our derknessis weren maad on al the erthe to the nynthe our.
 and aboute the nynthe our jhesus criede with a greet vois and seide heli heli lamazabatany that is my god my god whi hast thou forsake me.
 and summen that stoden there and herynge seiden this clepith helye.
 and anoon oon of hem rennynge took and fillide a spounge with vynegre and puttide on a rehed and af to hym to drynke.
 but othir seiden suffre thou.

 forsothe jhesus eftsoone criede with a greet voyce and af vp the goost.
 and lo.

 and birielis weren openyd and many bodies of seyntis that hadden slepte rysen vp.
 and thei eden out of her birielis and aftir his resurreccioun thei camen in to the holi citee and apperiden to many.
 and the centurien and thei that weren with hym kepinge jhesu whanne thei saien the erthe schakynge and tho thingis that weren doon thei dredden greetli and seiden verili this was goddis sone.
 and ther weren there many wymmen afer that sueden jhesu fro galilee and mynystriden to hym.
 among whiche was marie magdalene and marie the modir of james and of joseph and the modir of zebedees sones.
 but whanne the euenyng was come ther cam a riche man of armathi joseph bi name and he was a disciple of jhesu.
 he wente to pilat and axide the bodi of jhesu.
 thanne pilat comaundide the bodie to be ouun.
 and whanne the bodi was takun joseph lappide it in a clene sendel and leide it in his newe biriel that he hadde hewun in a stoon.
 and he walewide a greet stoon to the dore of the biriel and wente awei.
 but marie maudelene and anothir marie weren there sittynge aens the sepulcre.
 and on the tother dai that is aftir pask euen the princis of prestis and the farisees camen togidere to pilat and seiden sir we han mynde that thilke giloure seide it lyuynge aftir thre daies y schal rise aen to lijf.
 therfor comaunde thou that the sepulcre be kept in to the thridde dai.
 lest hise disciplis comen and stelen hym and seie to the puple he hath rise fro deeth.
 and the laste errour schal be worse than the formere.
 pilat seide to hem e han the kepyng.

 and thei eden forth and kepten the sepulcre markynge the stoon with keperis.
 but in the euentid of the sabat that bigynneth to schyne in the firste dai of the woke marie mawdelene cam and another marie to se the sepulcre.
 and lo.
 ther was maad a greet ertheschakyng.
 for the aungel of the lord cam doun fro heuene and neiede and turnede awei the stoon and sat theron.
 and his lokyng was as leit and hise clothis as snowe.
 and for drede of hym the keperis weren afeerd and thei weren maad as deede men.
 but the aungel answeride and seide to the wymmen nyle e drede for y woot that e seken jhesu that was crucified.
 he is not here for he is risun as he seide.
 come e and se e the place where the lord was leid.
 and go e soone and seie e to his disciplis that he is risun.
 and lo.
 he schal go bifore ou in to galilee.

 and thei wenten out soone fro the biriels with drede and greet ioye rennynge to telle to hise disciplis.
 and lo.
 jhesus mette hem and seide heile e.
 and thei neieden and heelden his feet and worschipiden him.
 thanne jhesus seide to hem nyle e drede.
 go e telle e to my britheren that thei go in to galile.
 there thei schulen se me.
 and whanne thei weren goon lo.
 summe of the keperis camen in to the citee and telden to the princis of prestis alle thingis that weren doon.
 and whanne thei weren gaderid togidere with the elder men and hadden take her counseil thei auen to the knitis miche monei and seiden seie e that hise disciplis camen bi nyt and han stolen hym while e slepten.
 and if this be herd of the iustice we schulen counseile hym and make ou sikir.
 and whanne the monei was takun thei diden as thei weren taut.
 and this word is pupplischid among the jewis til in to this day.
 and the enleuen disciplis wenten in to galilee in to an hille where jhesus hadde ordeyned to hem.
 and thei sayn hym and worschipiden.
 but summe of hem doutiden.
 and jhesus cam ny and spak to hem and seide al power in heuene and in erthe is ouun to me.
 therfor go e and teche alle folkis baptisynge hem in the name of the fadir and of the sone and of the hooli goost.
 techynge hem to kepe alle thingis what euer thingis y haue comaundid to ou.
 and lo.
