 and god made sterris.
 and settide tho in the firmament of heuene that tho schulden schyne on erthe and that tho schulden be bifore to the dai and nyt and schulden departe lit and derknesse.
 and god sei that it was good.
 and the euentid and the morwetid was maad the fourthe dai.
 also god seide the watris brynge forth a crepynge beeste of lyuynge soule and a brid fleynge aboue erthe vndur the firmament of heuene.
 and god made of nout grete whallis and ech lyuynge soule and mouable whiche the watris han brout forth in to her kyndis.

 and he restide in the seuenthe dai fro al his werk which he hadde maad.
 and he blesside the seuenthe dai and halewide it.
 for in that dai god ceesside of al his werk which he made of nout that he schulde make.
 these ben the generaciouns of heuene and of erthe in the day wherynne the lord god made heuene and erthe and ech litil tre of erthe bifore that it sprong out in erthe.
 and he made ech erbe of the feeld bifore that it buriownede.
 for the lord god had not reyned on erthe and no man was that wroute erthe.
 but a welle stiede out of the erthe and moistide al the hiere part of erthe.
 therfor the lord god formede man of the sliym of erthe and brethide in to his face the brething of lijf.
 and man was maad in to a lyuynge soule.
 forsothe the lord god plauntide at the bigynnyng paradis of likyng wherynne he settide man whom he hadde formed.
 and the lord god broute forth of the erthe ech tre fair in sit and swete to ete.
 also he broute forth the tre of lijf in the middis of paradis and the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel.
 and a ryuer ede out fro the place of likyng to moyste paradis which ryuer is departid fro thennus in to foure heedis.
 the name of the o ryuer is fyson thilke it is that cumpassith al the lond of euilath where gold cometh forth and the gold of that lond is the beste and there is foundun delium that is a tree of spicerie and the stoon onychyn.
 and the name to the secounde ryuer is gyon thilke it is that cumpassith al the loond of ethiopie.
 forsothe the name of the thridde ryuer is tigris thilke goith aens assiriens.
 sotheli the fourthe ryuer is thilke eufrates.
 therfor the lord god took man and settide hym in paradis of likyng that he schulde worche and kepe it.
 and god comaundide to hym and seide ete thou of ech tre of paradis.
 forsothe ete thou not of the tre of kunnyng of good and of yuel.
 for in what euere dai thou schalt ete therof thou schalt die bi deeth.
 and the lord god seide it is not good that a man be aloone make we to hym an help lijk to hym silf.
 therfor whanne alle lyuynge beestis of erthe and alle the volatils of heuene weren formed of erthe the lord god broute tho to adam that he schulde se what he schulde clepe tho.
 for al thing that adam clepide of lyuynge soule thilke is the name therof.
 and adam clepide bi her names alle lyuynge thingis and alle volatils and alle vnresonable beestis of erthe.
 forsothe to adam was not foundun an helpere lijk hym.
 therfore the lord god sente sleep in to adam and whanne he slepte god took oon of hise ribbis and fillide fleisch for it.
 and the lord god bildide the rib which he hadde take fro adam in to a womman and broute hir to adam.
 and adam seide this is now a boon of my boonys and fleisch of my fleisch.
 this schal be clepid virago for she is takun of man.
 wherfor a man schal forsake fadir and modir and schal cleue to his wijf and thei schulen be tweyne in o fleisch.
 forsothe euer eithir was nakid that is adam and his wijf and thei weren not aschamed.
 but and the serpent was feller than alle lyuynge beestis of erthe whiche the lord god hadde maad.
 which serpent seide to the womman why comaundide god to ou that e schulden not ete of ech tre of paradis.
 to whom the womman answerde we eten of the fruyt of trees that ben in paradis.
 sothely god comaundide to vs that we schulden not ete of the fruyt of the tre which is in the myddis of paradijs and that we schulden not touche it lest perauenture we dien.
 forsothe the serpent seide to the womman e schulen not die bi deeth.
 for whi god woot that in what euere dai e schulen ete therof oure ien schulen be opened and e schulen be as goddis knowynge good and yuel.
 therfor the womman sei that the tre was good and swete to ete and fair to the ien and delitable in biholdyng.
 and sche took of the fruyt therof and eet and af to hir hosebonde and he eet.
 and the ien of bothe weren openid.
 and whanne thei knewen that thei weren nakid thei sewiden the leeues of a fige tre and maden brechis to hem silf.
 and whanne thei herden the vois of the lord god goynge in paradijs at the wynd after myddai adam and his wijf hidden hem fro the face of the lord god in the middis of the tre of paradijs.
 and the lord god clepide adam and seide to hym where art thou.
 and adam seide y herde thi vois in paradijs and y drede for y was nakid and y hidde me.
 to whom the lord seide who forsothe schewide to thee that thou were nakid no but for thou hast ete of the tre of which y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete.
 and adam seide the womman which thou auest felowe to me af me of the tre and y eet.
 and the lord seide to the womman whi didist thou this thing.
 which answerde the serpent disseyued me and y eet.
 and the lord god seide to the serpent for thou didist this thou schalt be cursid among alle lyuynge thingis and vnresonable beestis of erthe.
 thou schalt go on thi brest and thou schalt ete erthe in alle daies of thi liif.
 y schal sette enemytees bitwixe thee and the womman and bitwixe thi seed and hir seed.
 sche schal breke thin heed and thou schalt sette aspies to hir heele.
 also god seide to the womman y schal multiplie thi wretchidnessis and thi conseyuyngis.
 in sorewe thou schalt bere thi children.
 and thou schalt be vndur power of the hosebonde and he schal be lord of thee.
 sothely god seyde to adam for thou herdist the voys of thi wijf and hast ete of the tree of which y comaundide to thee that thou schuldist not ete the erthe schal be cursid in thi werk.
 in traueylis thou schalt ete therof in alle daies of thi lijf.
 it schal brynge forth thornes and breris to thee and thou schalt ete eerbis of the erthe.
 in swoot of thi cheer thou schalt ete thi breed til thou turne aen in to the erthe of which thou art takun.
 for thou art dust and thou schalt turne aen in to dust.
 and adam clepide the name of his wijf eue for sche was the moder of alle men lyuynge.
 and the lord god made cootis of skynnys to adam and eue his wijf and clothide hem.
 and seide lo.
 adam is maad as oon of vs and knowith good and yuel.
 now therfore se e lest perauenture he putte his hond and take of the tre of lijf and ete and lyue with outen ende.
 and the lord god sente hym out of paradijs of likyng that he schulde worche the erthe of which he was takun.
 and god castide out adam and settide bifore paradis of lykyng cherubyn and a swerd of flawme and turnynge aboute to kepe the weie of the tre of lijf.
 forsothe adam knewe eue his wijf which conseyuede and childide cayn and seide y haue gete a man bi god.
 and efte sche childide his brother abel.
 forsothe abel was a kepere of scheep and cayn was an erthe tilyere.
 sotheli it was don after many daies that cayn offride iftis to the lord of the fruytis of erthe.
 and abel offride of the first gendrid of his floc and of the fatnesse of tho.
 and the lord bihelde to abel and to the iftis of hym.
 sotheli he bihelde not to cayn and to hise iftis.
 and cayn was wrooth greetli and his cheer felde doun.
 and the lord seide to hym whi art thou wrooth and whi felde doun thi face.
 whether not if thou schalt do wel thou schalt resseyue.
 but if thou doist yuele thi synne schal be present anoon in the atis.
 but the desir therof schal be vndur thee and thou schalt be lord therof.
 and cayn seide to abel his brother go we out.
 and whanne thei weren in the feeld cayn roos aens his brother abel and killide him.
 and the lord seide to cayn where is abel thi brother.
 which answerde y woot not.
 whether y am the kepere of my brothir.
 and god seide to cayn what hast thou do.
 the vois of the blood of thi brother crieth to me fro erthe.
 now therfor thou schalt be cursid on erthe that openyde his mouth and resseyuede of thin hond the blood of thi brothir.
 whanne thou schalt worche the erthe it schal not yue his fruytis to thee.
 thou schalt be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute on erthe in alle the daies of thi lijf.
 and cayn seide to the lord my wickidnesse is more than that y disserue foryuenesse.
 lo.
 to dai thou castist me out fro the face of the erthe.
 and y schal be hid fro thi face and y schal be vnstable of dwellyng and fleynge aboute in erthe.
 therfore ech man that schal fynde me schal slee me.
 and the lord seide to hym it schal not be don so but ech man that schal slee cayn shal be punyschid seuenfold.
 and the lord settide a signe in cayn that ech man that schulde fynde hym schulde not slee hym.
 and cayn ede out fro the face of the lord and dwellide fleynge aboute in erthe at the eest coost of eden.
 forsothe cayn knewe his wiif which conseyuede and childide enoth.
 and cayn bildide a citee and clepide the name therof of the name of hise sone enoth.
 forsothe enoth gendride irad and irad gendride manyael and manyael gendride matusael and matusael gendride lameth.
 that took twei wyues the name to o wijf was ada and the name to the tother was sella.
 and ada gendride jabel that was the fadir of dwellers in tentis and of shepherdis.
 and the name of his brother was tubal he was the fadir of syngeris in harpe and orgun.
 and sella gendride tubalcayn that was an hamerbetere and smyt on alle werkis of bras and of yrun.
 forsothe the sistir of tubalcayn was neoma.
 and lameth seide to his wyues ada and sella e wyues of lameth here my vois and herkne my word.
 for y haue slayn a man bi my wounde and a ong wexynge man bi my violent betyng.
 veniaunce schal be ouun seuenfold of cayn forsothe of lameth seuentisithis seuensithis.
 also it adam knewe his wijf and sche childide a sone and clepide his name seth and seide god hath put to me another seed for abel whom cayn killide.
 but also a sone was borun to seth which sone he clepide enos.
 this enos bigan to clepe inwardli the name of the lord.
 this is the book of generacioun of adam in the dai wher ynne god made man of nout.
 god made man to the ymage and licnesse of god.
 god formede hem male and female and blesside hem and clepide the name of hem adam in the day in which thei weren formed.
 forsothe adam lyuede an hundrid eer and thretti and gendride a sone to his ymage and liknesse and clepide his name seth.
 and the daies of adam after that he gendride seth weren maad eite hundrid eer and he gendride sones and doutris.

 forsothe noe whanne he was of fyue hundrid eer gendride sem cham and jafeth.
 and whanne men bigunnen to be multiplied on erthe and hadden gendrid doutris the sones of god seien the doutris of men that thei weren faire and token wyues to hem of alle whiche thei hadden chose.
 and god seide my spirit schal not dwelle in man with outen ende for he is fleisch.
 and the daies of hym schulen be an hundrid and twenti eer.
 sotheli giauntis weren on erthe in tho daies forsothe aftir that the sones of god entriden to the doutris of men and tho doutris gendriden.
 these weren myti of the world and famouse men.
 sotheli god sei that myche malice of men was in erthe and that al the thout of herte was ententif to yuel in al tyme and repentide him that he hadde maad man in erthe.
 and god was war bifore aens tyme to comyng and was touchid with sorewe of herte with ynne.
 and seide y schal do awei man whom y made of nout fro the face of the erthe fro man til to lyuynge thingis fro crepynge beeste til to the briddis of heuene.
 for it repentith me that y made hem.
 forsothe noe foond grace bifore the lord.
 these ben the generaciouns of noe.

 the erthe is fillid with wickidnesse of the face of hem and y schal distrye hem with the erthe.
 make thou to thee a schip of trees hewun and planed.
 thou schalt make dwellynge placis in the schip and thou schalt anoynte it with pitche with ynne and with outforth.
 and so thou schalt make it.
 the lengthe of the schip schal be of thre hundrid cubitis the brede schal be of fifti cubitis and the hinesse therof schal be of thretti cubitis.
 thou schalt make a wyndow in the schip and thou schalt ende the hinesse therof in a cubite.

 of alle clene lyuynge beestis thou schalt take bi seuene and bi seuene male and female.
 forsothe of vnclene lyuynge beestis thou schalt take bi tweyne and bi tweyne male and female.
 but also of volatils of heuene thou schalt take bi seuene and bi seuene male and female that her seed be saued on the face of al erthe.
 for it and aftir seuene daies y schal reyne on erthe fourti daies and fourti nytis and y schal do awey al substaunce which y made fro the face of erthe.
 therfor noe dide alle thingis whiche the lord comaundide to hym.
 and he was of sixe hundrid eer whanne the watris of the greet flood flowiden on erthe.
 and noe entride in to the schip and hise sones and hise wijf and the wyues of his sones entriden with him for the watris of the greet flood.

 and the greet flood was maad fourti daies and fourti nitis on erthe and the watris weren multiplied and reiseden the schip on hi fro erthe.
 the watris flowiden greetli and filliden alle thingis in the face of erthe.
 forsothe the schip was borun on the watris.
 and the watris hadden maistrie greetli on erthe and alle hie hillis vndur alle heuene weren hilid.
 the watyr was hiere bi fiftene cubitis ouer the hilis whiche it hilide.
 and ech fleisch was wastid that was moued on erthe of briddis of lyuynge beestis of vnresonable beestis and of alle reptilis that crepen on erthe.

 forsothe the lord hadde mynde of noe and of alle lyuynge beestis and of alle werk beestis that weren with hym in the schip.
 and broute a wynd on the erthe.
 and watris weren decreessid and the wellis of the see weren closid and the wyndowis of heuene weren closid and reynes of heuene weren ceessid.

 therfor in the sixe hundrid and o eer of the lijf of noe in the firste monethe in the firste day of the monethe watris weren decreessid on erthe.
 and noe openede the roof of the schip and bihelde and sei that the face of the erthe was dried.
 in the secunde monethe in the seuene and twentithe dai of the monethe the erthe was maad drie.
 sotheli the lord spak to noe.
 and seide go out of the schip thou and thi wijf thi sones and the wyues of thi sones with thee.
 and lede out with thee alle lyuynge beestis that ben at thee of ech fleisch as wel in volatilis as in vnresonable beestis and alle reptils that crepen on erthe.

 forsothe noe bildide an auter to the lord and he took of alle clene beestis and briddis and offride brent sacrifices on the auter.
 and the lord sauerede the odour of swetnesse and seide to hym y schal no more curse the erthe for men for the wit and thout of mannus herte ben redi in to yuel fro ong wexynge age.
 therfor y schal no more smyte ech lyuynge soule as y dide.

 therfore thei that eden out of the schip weren noe sem cham and japheth.

 and sotheli sem and jafeth puttiden a mentil on her schuldris and thei eden bacward and hileden the schameful membris of her fadir and her faces weren turned awei and thei sien not the priuy membris of her fadir.
 and forsothe noe wakide of the wyn and whanne he hadde lerned what thingis his lesse sone hadde do to hym he seide cursid be the child canaan he schal be seruaunt of seruauntis to hise britheren.
 and noe seide blessid be the lord god of sem and chanaan be the seruaunt to sem.

 folkis in erthe weren departid of these aftir the greet flood.
 forsothe the lond was of o langage and of the same speche.
 and whanne thei eden forth fro the eest thei fonden a feeld in the lond of sennaar and dwelliden ther ynne.
 and oon seide to his neibore come e and make we tiel stonys and bake we tho with fier.

 and therfor the name therof was clepid babel for the langage of al erthe was confoundide there.
 and fro thennus the lord scaterede hem on the face of alle cuntrees.
 these ben the generaciouns of sem.
 sem was of an hundrid eer whanne he gendride arfaxath twey eer aftir the greet flood.
 and sem lyuede aftir that he gendride arfaxath fyue hundrid eer and gendride sones and doutris.
 forsothe arfaxath lyuede fyue and thretti eer and gendride sale.

 sotheli these ben the generaciouns of thare.
 thare gendride abram nachor and aran.
 forsothe aran gendride loth.
 and aran diede bifore thare his fadir in the lond of his natiuite in vr of caldeis.
 forsothe abram and nachor weddiden wyues.
 the name of the wijf of abram was saray and the name of the wiif of nachor was melcha the douter of aran fadir of melcha and fadir of jescha.
 sotheli saray was bareyn and hadde no children.
 and so thare took abram his sone and loth the sone of aran his sone and saray his douter in lawe the wijf of abram his sone and ledde hem out of vr of caldeis that thei schulen go in to the lond of chanaan.
 and thei camen til to aran and dwelliden there.
 and the daies of thare weren maad two hundrid eer and fyue and he was deed in aran.
 forsothe the lord seide to abram go thou out of thi lond and of thi kynrede and of the hous of thi fadir and come thou in to the lond which y schal schewe to thee.
 and y schal make thee in to a greet folk and y schal blisse thee and y schal magnyfie thi name and thou schalt be blessid.
 y schal blesse hem that blessen thee and y schal curse hem that cursen thee.
 and alle kynredis of erthe schulen be blessid in thee.
 and so abram ede out as the lord comaundide hym and loth ede with hym.
 abram was of thre scoor eer and fiftene whanne he ede out of aran.
 and he took saray his wijf and loth the sone of his brother and al the substaunce which thei hadden in possessioun and the men whiche thei hadden bigete in aran.
 and thei eden out that thei schulen go in to the loond of chanaan.
 and whanne they camen in to it abram passide thorou the lond til to the place of sichem and til to the noble valey.
 forsothe chananei was thanne in the lond.
 sotheli the lord apperide to abram and seide to hym y schal yue this lond to thi seed.
 and abram bildide there an auter to the lord that apperide to hym.
 and fro thennus he passide forth to the hil bethel that was aens the eest and settide there his tabernacle hauynge bethel fro the west and hay fro the eest.
 and he bildide also there an auter to the lord and inwardli clepide his name.
 and abram ede goynge and goynge forth ouer to the south.
 sotheli hungur was maad in the lond.
 and abram ede doun in to egipt to be a pilgrime ther for hungur hadde maistrie in the lond.
 and whanne he was ny to entre in to egipt he seide to saray his wijf y knowe that thou art a fair womman and that whanne egipcians schulen se thee thei schulen seie it is his wijf and thei schulen sle me and schulen reserue thee.
 therfor y biseche thee seie thou that thou art my sistir that it be wel to me for thee and that my lijf lyue for loue of thee.
 and so whanne abram hadde entrid in to egipt egipcians sien the womman that sche was ful fair.
 and the prynces telden to farao and preiseden hir anentis him.
 and the womman was takun vp in to the hous of farao.
 forsothe thei vsiden wel abram for hir.
 and scheep and oxun and assis and seruauntis and seruauntessis and sche assis and camels weren to hym.
 forsothe the lord beet farao and his hous with moste veniaunces for saray the wijf of abram.
 and farao clepide abram and seide to hym what is it that thou hast do to me.
 whi schewidist thou not to me that sche was thi wijf.
 for what cause seidist thou that sche was thi sister that y schulde take hir in to wife to me.
 now therfor lo.
 thi wiif.
 take thou hir and go.
 and farao comaundide to men on abram and thei ledden forth hym and his wijf and alle thingis that he hadde.
 therfore abram stiede fro egipt he and his wijf and alle thingis that he hadde.
 and loth stiede with hym to the south coost.
 forsothe he was ful riche in possessyoun of siluer and of gold.
 and he turnede aen bi the weye in which he cam fro the south in to bethel til to the place in which bifore he hadde sett tabernacle bitwixe bethel and hay in the place of the auter which he made bifore and inwardli clepide there the name of the lord.
 but also flockis of scheep and droues of oxun and tabernaclis weren to loth that was with abram.
 and the lond mite not take hem that thei schulden dwelle togidre for the catel of hem was myche and thei miten not dwelle in comyn.
 wherfor also strijf was maad bitwixe the keperis of flockis of abram and of loth.
 forsothe chananei and feresei dwelliden in that lond in that tyme.
 therfor abram seide to loth y biseche that no strijf be bitwixe me and thee and bitwixe my scheepherdis and thi scheepherdis.
 for we ben britheren.
 lo.
 al the lond is bifore thee y biseche departe thou fro me.
 if thou go to the left side y schal holde the rit side.
 if thou chese the rit side y schal go to the left side.
 and so loth reiside hise ien and sei aboute al the cuntrei of jordan which was al moistid bifor that the lord distriede sodom and gomorre as paradis of the lord and as egipt as men comen in to segor.
 and loth chees to him the cuntre aboute jordan and departide fro the eest.
 and thei weren departid ech fro his brother.
 abram dwellide in the lond of chanaan.
 sotheli loth dwellide in townes aboute jordan and wonide in sodom.
 forsothe men of sodom weren ful wickid and synneris greetly bifore the lord.
 and the lord seide to abram aftir that loth was departid fro him reise thin ien forth rit and se fro the place in which thou art now to the north and south to the eest and west.
 y schal yue al the lond which thou seest to thee and to thi seed til in to with outen ende.
 and y schal make thi seed as the dust of erthe.
 if ony man may noumbre the dust of erthe also he schal mowe noumbre thi seed.
 therfor rise thou and passe thorou the lond in his lengthe and breede for y schal yue it to thee.
 therfor abram mouynge his tabernacle cam and dwellide bisidis the valei of mambre which is in ebron.
 and he bildide there an auter to the lord.
 forsothe it was don in that tyme that amrafel kyng of sennaar and ariok kyng of ponte and chodorlaomor kyng of elemytis and tadal kyng of folkis bigunnen batel aens bara kyng of sodom and aens bersa kyng of gomorre and aens sennaar kyng of adama and aens semeber kyng of seboym and aens the kyng of bale.
 thilke bale is segor.
 alle these camen togidre in to the valey of wode which is now the see of salt.
 for in twelue eer thei seruyden chodorlaomor and in the threttenthe eer thei departiden fro hym.
 therfor chodorlaomor cam in the fourtenthe eer and kyngis that weren with him and thei han smyte rafaym in astaroth carnaym and susym with hem and emym in sabe cariathaym and choreis in the hillis of seir til to the feldi placis of faran which is in wildirnesse.
 and thei turneden aen and camen til to the welle mesphath.
 thilke is cades.
 and thei han smyte al the cuntre of men of amalec and amorrei that dwellide in asason thamar.
 and the kyng of sodom and the king of gomorre and the kyng of adama and the kyng of seboym also and the kyng of bale which is segor eden out and dressiden scheltrun aens hem in the valei of wode that is aens chodorlaomor kyng of elamytis and thadal kyng of folkis and amrafel kyng of sennaar and ariok kyng of ponte.
 foure kyngis aens fyue.
 forsothe the valey of the wode hadde many pittis of pitche.
 and so the kyng of sodom and the kyng of gomorre turneden the backis and felden doun there.
 and thei that leften fledden to the hil.
 sotheli thei token awei al the catel of sodom and gomorre and alle thingis that perteynen to mete and eden awei.
 also and thei token awey loth and his catel the sone of the brother of abram which loth dwellide in sodom.
 and lo.
 oon that ascapide telde to abram ebrew that dwellide in the valei of mambre of amorrei brother of escol and brother of aner.
 for these maden couenaunt of pees with abram.
 and whanne abram hadde herd this thing that is loth his brothir takun he noumbride his borun seruauntis maad redy thre hundrid and eitene and pursuede hem til to dan.
 and whanne his felowis weren departid he felde on hem in the nit and he smoot hem and pursuede hem til to hoba and fenyce which is at the left side of damask.
 and he broute aen al the catel and loth his brother with his catel also wymmen and the puple.
 sotheli the kyng of sodom ede out in to the metyng of him after that he turnede aen fro sleyng of chodorlaomor and of kyngis that weren with him in the valei of sabe which is the valey of the kyng.
 and sotheli melchisedech kyng of salem broute forth breed and wyn for he was the preest of hieste god.
 and he blesside abram and seide blessid be abram of hi god that made heuene and erthe of nout and blessid be hi god bi whom defendynge enemyes ben bitakun in thin hondis.
 and abram af tithis of alle thingis to hym.
 forsothe the kyng of sodom seide to abram yue thou the men to me.
 take thou othir thingis to thee.
 and abram answerde to hym y reyse myn hondis to the hi lord god lord of heuene and of erthe that fro the threde of oof til to the layner of the hose i schal not take of alle thingis that ben thine lest thou seie i made abram riche.
 out takun these thingis whiche the onge men eeten and the partis of men that camen with me aner escol and mambre.
 these men schulen take her partis.
 and so whanne these thingis weren don the word of the lord was maad to abram bi a visioun and seide abram nyle thou drede y am thi defender and thi meede is ful greet.
 and abram seide lord god what schalt thou yue to me.
 y schal go with oute fre children and this damask sone of elieser the procuratour of myn hous schal be myn eir.
 and abram addide sotheli thou hast not oue seed to me and lo.
 my borun seruaunt schal be myn eir.
 and anoon the word of the lord was maad to hym and seide this schal not be thin eir but thou schalt haue hym eir that schal go out of thi wombe.
 and the lord ledde out abram and seide to hym biholde thou heuene and noumbre thou sterris if thou maist.
 and the lord seide to abram so thi seed schal be.
 abram bileuede to god and it was arettid to hym to ritfulnesse.
 and god seide to hym y am the lord that ladde thee out of vr of caldeis that y schulde yue this lond to thee and thou schuldist haue it in possessioun.
 and abram seide lord god wherbi may i wite that y schal welde it.
 and the lord answerde and seide take thou to me a cow of thre eer and a geet of thre eer and a ram of thre eer a turtle also and a culuer.
 which took alle these thingis and departide tho bi the myddis and settide euer eithir partis ech aens other.
 but he departide not the briddis.
 and foulis camen doun on the careyns and abram drof hem awey.
 and whanne the sunne was gon doun drede felde on abram and a greet hidousenesse and derk asaylide him.
 and it was seid to hym wite thou bifore knowinge that thi seed schal be pilgrim foure hundrid eer in a lond not his owne and thei schulen make hem suget to seruage and thei schulen turment hem.
 netheles y schal deme the folk to whom thei schulen serue.
 and aftir these thingis thei schulen go out with greet catel.
 forsothe thou schalt go to thi fadris in pees and schalt be biried in good age.
 sotheli in the fourthe generacioun thei schulen turne aen hidir for the wickidnesses of amoreis ben not it fillid til to present tyme.
 therfor whanne the sunne was gon doun a derk myst was maad and a furneis smokynge apperide and a laumpe of fier and passide thorou tho departingis.
 in that dai the lord made a couenaunt of pees with abram and seide y schal yue to thi seed this lond fro the ryuer of egipt til to the greet ryuer eufrates.
 cyneis and cyneseis and cethmoneis and etheis and fereseis and raphaym and amorreis and cananeis and gergeseis and jebuseis.
 therfor sarai wijf of abram hadde not gendrid fre children.
 but sche hadde a seruauntesse of egipt agar bi name and seide to hir hosebonde lo.
 the lord hath closid me that y schulde not bere child.
 entre thou to my seruauntesse if in hap y schal take children nameli of hir.
 and whanne he assentide to hir preiynge sche took agar egipcian hir seruauntesse after ten eer aftir that thei begunne to enhabite in the lond of chanaan and sche af agar wiif to hir hosebonde.
 and abram entride to agar.
 and agar sei that sche hadde conseyued and sche dispiside hir ladi.
 and saray seide to abram thou doist wickidli aens me.

 the lord deme betwixe me and thee.
 and abram answerde and seide to hir lo.
 thi seruauntesse is in thin hond.
 vse thou hir as it likith.
 therfor for sarai turmentide hir sche fledde awei.
 and whanne the aungel of the lord hadde founde hir bisidis a welle of watir in wildernesse which welle is in the weie of sur in deseert he seide to hir fro whennus comest thou agar the seruauntesse of sarai and whidur goist thou.
 which answerde y fle fro the face of sarai my ladi.
 and the aungel of the lord seide to hir turne thou aen to thi ladi and be thou mekid vndur hir hondis.
 and eft he seide y multipliynge schal multiplie thi seed and it schal not be noumbrid for multitude.
 and aftirward he seide lo.

 this schal be a wielde man.
 his hond schal be aens alle men and the hondis of alle men schulen be aens him.
 and he schal sette tabernaclis euene aens alle his britheren.
 forsothe agar clepide the name of the lord that spak to hir thou god that seiest me.
 for sche seide forsothe here y sei the hynderere thingis of him that si me.
 therfor sche clepide thilke pit the pit of hym that lyueth and seeth me.
 thilk pit is bitwixe cades and barad.
 and agar childide a sone to abram which clepide his name ismael.
 abram was of eiti eere and sixe whanne agar childide ysmael to hym.
 forsothe aftir that abram bigan to be of nynti eer and nyne the lord apperide to hym and seide to him y am almyti god.

 and abram felde doun lowe on his face.
 and god seide to hym y am and my couenaunt of pees is with thee and thou schalt be the fadir of many folkis.
 and thi name schal no more be clepid abram but thou schalt be clepid abraham for y haue maad thee fadir of many folkis.
 and y schal make thee to wexe ful greetli and y schal sette thee in folkis and kyngis schulen go out of thee.

 a man whos fleisch of his erde schal not be circumsidid thilke man schal be doon a wei fro his puple.
 for he made voide my couenaunt.

 and the lord seide wher y mowe hele fro abraham what thingis y schal do sithen he schal be in to a greet folk and moost strong and alle naciouns of erthe schulen be blessid in hym.
 for y woot that abraham schal comaunde hise children and his hows after hym that thei kepe the weie of the lord and that thei do ritfulnesse and dom that the lord bringe for abraham alle thingis whiche he spak to abraham.
 and so the lord seide the cry of men of sodom and of men of gomorre is multiplied and her synne is agreggid greetli.
 y schal come doun and schal se whether thei han fillid in werk the cry that cam to me that y wite whether it is not so.
 and thei turneden han fro thennus and eden to sodom.
 abraham sotheli stood it bifore the lord and neiede and seide whether thou schalt leese a iust man with the wickid man.
 if fifti iust men ben in the citee schulen thei perische to gidere and schalt thou not spare that place for fifti iust men if thei ben ther ynne.
 fer be it fro thee that thou do this thing and sle a iust man with a wickid man and that a iust man be maad as a wickid man.
 this is not thin that demest al erthe.
 thou schalt not make this doom.
 and the lord seide to him if y schal fynde in sodom fifti iust men in the myddis of the citee y schal foryue to al the place for hem.
 abraham answerde and seide for y bigan onys y schal speke to my lord sithen y am dust and aische.
 what if lesse than fifti iust men bi fyue ben schalt thou do awey al the cite for fyue and fourti.
 and the lord seide y schal not do awei if i schal fynde fyue and fourti there.
 and eft abraham seide to hym but if fourti ben there what schalt thou do.
 the lord seide y schal not smyte for fourti.
 abraham seide lord y biseche take thou not to indignacioun if y speke.
 what if thretti be foundun there.
 the lord answerde y schal not do if y schal fynde thretti there.
 abraham seide for y bigan onys y schal speke to my lord.
 what if twenti be foundun there.
 the lord seide y schal not sle for twenti.
 abraham seide lord y biseche be thou not wrooth if y speke it onys.
 what if ten be founden there.
 the lord seide y schal not do awey for ten.
 the lord ede forth after that he ceesside to speke to abraham and abraham turnede aen in to his place.
 and tweyne aungels camen to sodom in the euentide while loth sat in the atis of the citee.
 and whanne he hadde seyn hem he roos and ede aens hem and worschipide lowe to erthe and seide my lordis y biseche bowe e in to the hous of oure child and dwelle e there.
 waische e oure feet and in the morewtid e schulen go in to oure weie.
 whiche seiden nay but we schulen dwelle in the street.
 he constreynede hem greetli that thei schulden turne to hym.
 and whanne thei weren entrid in to his hous he made a feeste he bakide therf breed and thei eten.
 forsothe bifore that thei eden to sleepe men of the citee compassiden his hows fro a child til to an eld man al the puple togidre.
 and thei clepiden loth and seiden to him where ben the men that entriden to thee to nyt.
 brynge hem out hidur that we knowe hem.
 and loth ede out to hem bihynde the bak and closide the dore and seide y biseche nyle e my britheren nyle e do this yuel.
 y haue twey doutris that knewen not it man.
 y schal lede out hem to ou and mys vse e hem as it plesith ou so that e doon noon yuel to these men for thei entriden vndur the schadewe of my roof.
 and thei seiden go thou fro hennus.
 and eft thei seiden thou entridist as a comelyng.
 wher that thou deme.
 therfor we schulen turment thee more than these.
 and thei diden violentli to loth ful greetli.
 thanne it was ny that thei wolden breke the doris.
 and lo.
 the men puttiden hoond and ledden in loth to hem and thei closiden the dore.
 and thei smyten with blyndenesse hem that weren withoutforth fro the leest til to the moost.
 so that thei myten not fynde the dore.
 forsothe thei seiden to loth hast thou here ony man of thine hosebonde of thi douter ethir sones ethir doutris.
 lede thou out of this citee alle men that ben thine for we schulen do awey this place for the cry of hem encreesside bifor the lord which sente vs that we leese hem.
 and so loth ede out and spak to the hosebondys of his doutris that schulden take hise doutris and seide rise e and go e out of this place.
 for the lord schal do awey this citee.
 and he was seyn to hem to speke as pleiynge.
 and whanne the morewtid was the aungels constreyneden hym and seiden rise thou and take thi wijf and thi twey doutris whiche thou hast lest also thou perische to gidere in the synne of the citee.
 while he dissymelide thei token his hond and the hond of his wijf and of his twey doutris.
 for the lord sparide hym.
 and thei ledden out hym and settiden with out the citee.
 there thei spaken to him and seiden saue thou thi lijf.
 nyle thou biholde bihynde thi bac nether stond thou in al the cuntre aboute but make thee saaf in the hil.
 lest also thou perische togidere.
 and loth seide to hem my lord y biseche for thi seruaunt hath founde grace bifore thee and thou hast magnyfied thi grace and mercy which thou hast do with me that thou schuldist saue my lijf.
 y may not be saued in the hil lest perauenture yuel take me and y die.
 a litil citee is here bisidis to which y may fle and y schal be saued ther ynne.
 where it is not a litil citee.
 and my soule schal lyue ther ynne.
 and he seide to loth lo.
 also in this y haue resseyued thi preieris that y distrye not the citee for which thou hast spoke.
 haste thou and be thou saued there for y may not do ony thing til thou entre thidur.
 therfor the name of that citee was clepid segor.
 the sunne roos on erthe and loth entride in to segor.
 therfor the lord reynede on sodom and gomorre brynston and fier fro the lord fro heuene and distriede these citees and al the cuntrey aboute.
 he destriede alle enhabiters of citees and all grene thingis of erthe.
 and his wijf lokide abac and was turned in to an ymage of salt.
 forsothe abraham risynge eerly where he stood bifore with the lord bihelde sodom and gomorre and al the lond of that cuntrey.
 and he sei a deed sparcle stiynge fro erthe as the smoke of a furneis.
 for whanne god distriede the citees of that cuntrey he hadde mynde of abraham and delyuerede loth fro destriynge of the citees in whiche he dwellide.
 and loth stiede fro segor and dwellide in the hil and hise twey doutris with him for he dredde to dwelle in segor.
 and he dwellide in a denne he and his twey doutris with hym.
 and the more doutre seide to the lasse oure fadre is eld and no man is left in erthe that may entre to vs bi the custom of al erthe.
 come thou make we him drunkun of wyn and slepe we with him that we moun kepe seed of oure fadir.
 and so thei auen to her fadir to drynke wyn in that nyt and the more douter entrede and slepte with hir fadir.
 and he feelide not nethir whanne the doutir lay doun nether whanne sche roos.
 and in the tothir dai the more doutir seide to the lasse lo.
 y slepte istirdai with my fadir yue we to hym to drynk wyn also in this nyt.
 and thou schalt slepe with hym that we saue seed of oure fadir.
 and thei auen to her fadir also in that nyt to drynke wyn and the lesse doutir entride and slepte with him.
 and sotheli he feelide not thanne whanne sche lay doun nether whanne sche roos.
 therfor the twei doutris of loth conseyuede of hir fadir.
 and the more doutre childide a sone and clepide his name moab.
 he is the fadir of men of moab til in to present dai.
 and the lesse douter childide a sone and clepide his name amon that is the sone of my puple.
 he is the fadir of men of amon til to day.
 abraham ede forth fro thennus in to the lond of the south and dwellide bitwixe cades and sur and was a pilgrym in geraris.
 and he seide of sare his wijf sche is my sistir.
 therfor abymalec kyng of gerare sente and took hir.
 sotheli god cam to abymalec bi a sweuene in the nyt and seide to hym lo.
 thou schalt die for the wooman which thou hast take for sche hath an hosebond.
 forsothe abymalech touchide not hir.
 and he seide lord whether thou schalt sle folc vnkunnynge and iust.
 whether he seide not to me sche is my sistir and sche seide he is my brother.
 in the symplenesse of myn herte and in the clennesse of myn hondis y dide this.
 and the lord seide to hym and y woot that thou didist bi symple herte and therfor y kepte thee lest thou didist synne aens me and i suffride not that thou touchidist hir.
 now therfor elde thou the wijf to hir hosebonde for he is a profete.
 and he schal preye for thee and thou schalt lyue.
 sotheli if thou nylte elde wite thou that thou schalt die bi deeth thou and alle thingis that ben thine.
 and anoon abynalech roos bi nyt and clepide alle his seruauntis and spak alle these wordis in the eeris of hem.
 and alle men dredden greetli.
 sotheli abymalec clepide also abraham and seide to hym what hast thou do to vs.
 what synneden we aens thee for thou hast brout in on me and on my rewme a greuouse synne.
 thou hast do to vs whiche thingis thou outist not do.
 and eft abimalech axide and seide what thing seiist thou that thou woldist do this.
 abraham answerde y thoute with me and seide in hap the drede of god is not in this place.
 and thei schulen sle me for my wijf.
 in other maner forsothe and sche is my sister verili the douter of my fadir and not the douter of my moder.
 and y weddide hir in to wijf.
 sotheli aftir that god ladde me out of the hous of my fadir y seide to hir thou schalt do this mercy with me in ech place to which we schulen entre.
 thou schalt seie that y am thi brother.
 therfore abymelech took scheep and oxun and seruauntis and handmaydenes and af to abraham.
 and he eldide to him sara his wijf and seide the lond is bifor ou.
 dwelle thou where euere it plesith thee.
 forsothe abymelech seide to sare lo.
 y af a thousand platis of siluer to thi brother.
 this schal be to thee in to hiling of ien to al men that ben with thee.
 and whider euere thou goist haue thou mynde that thou art takun.
 sotheli for abraham preiede god curide abymelech and his wijf and handmaydens and thei childiden.
 for god hadde closid ech wombe of the hows of abymelech for sare the wijf of abraham.
 forsothe god visitide sare as he bihite and fillide tho thingis that the spak.
 and sche conseyuede and childide a sone in hir eeld in the tyme wherynne god biforseide to hir.
 and abraham clepide the name of his sone whom sare childide to him ysaac.
 and abraham circumcidide hym in the eite dai as god comaundide to him whanne he was of an hundrid eer.
 for ysaac was borun in this age of the fadir.
 and sare seide the lord made leiynge to me and who euer schal here schal leie with me.
 and eft sche seide who schulde here and bileue to abraham that sare schulde yue soukyng to a sone whom sche childide to him now an eld man.
 therfor the child encreesside and was wenyd.
 and abraham made a greet feeste in the dai of his wenyng.
 and whanne sare sei the sone of agar egipcian pleiynge with ysaac hir sone sche seide to abraham cast thou out the handmayde and hir sone.
 for the sone of the handmayde schal not be eir with my sone ysaac.
 abraham took this heuyli for his sone.
 and god seide to hym be it not seyn scharp to thee on the child and on thin handmayde.
 alle thingis whiche sare seith to thee here thou hir vois for in isaac seed schal be clepid to thee.
 but also i schal make the sone of the handmaid in to a greet folk for he is thi seed.
 and so abraham roos eerli and took breed and a botel of watir and puttide on hir schuldre and bitook the child and lefte hir.
 and whanne sche hadde go sche ede out of the weie in the wildirnesse of bersabee.
 and whanne the watir in the botel was endid sche castide awei the child vndur a tre that was there.
 and sche ede awei and sche sat euene aens as fer as a bowe may caste.
 for sche seide y schal not se the child diynge.
 and sche sat aens and reiside hir vois and wepte.
 forsothe the lord herde the vois of the child and the aungel of the lord clepide agar fro heuene and seide what doist thou agar.
 nyle thou drede for god hath herd the vois of the child fro the place where ynne he is.
 rise thou and take the child and holde his hoond.
 for y schal make hym in to a greet folc.
 and god openyde hir ien and sche sei a pit of watir and sche ede and fillide the botel and sche af drynk to the child.
 and was with him and he encresside and dwellide in wildernesse and he was maad a ong man an archer and dwellide in the deseert of faran.
 and his modir took to him a wijf of the lond of egipt.
 in the same tyme abymelech and ficol prince of his oost seide to abraham god is with thee in alle thingis whiche thou doist.
 therfore swere thou bi god that thou noye not me and myn eiris and my kynrede.
 but bi the mersi whych y dide to thee do thou to me and to the lond in which thou lyuedist a comelyng.
 and abraham seide y schal swere.
 and he blamyde abymelech for the pit of watir which hise seruauntis token awey bi violence.
 and abymelech answerde i wiste not who dide this thing but also thou schewidist not to me and y herde not outakun to dai.
 and so abraham took scheep and oxun and af to abymalech and bothe smyten a boond of pees.
 and abraham settide seuene ewe lambren of the flok asidis half.
 and abymelech seide to hym what wolen these seuene ewe lambren to hem silf whiche thou madist stonde asidis half.
 and he seide thou schalt take of myn hond seuene ewe lambren that tho be in to witnessyng to me for y diggide this pit.
 therfor thilke place was clepid bersabee for euere eithir swore there.
 and thei maden boond of pees for the pit of an ooth.
 forsothe abymelech roos and ficol prince of his chyualrie and thei turneden aen in to the lond of palestyns.
 sotheli abraham plauntide a wode in bersabee and inwardli clepide there the name of euerlastinge god.
 and he was an erthetiliere ether a comelynge of the lond of palestynes in many dayes.
 and aftir that these thingis weren don god assaiede abraham and seide to hym abraham.
 abraham.
 he answerde y am present.
 god seide to him take thi sone oon gendrid whom thou louest ysaac.
 and go into the lond of visioun and offre thou hym there in to brent sacrifice on oon of the hillis whiche y schal schewe to thee.
 therfor abraham roos bi nit and sadlide his asse and ledde with hym twey onge men and ysaac his sone.
 and whanne he hadde hewe trees in to brent sacrifice he ede to the place which god hadde comaundid to him.
 forsothe in the thridde dai he reiside hise ien and sei a place afer.
 and he seide to hise children abide e here with the asse y and the child schulen go thidur.
 and aftir that we han worschipid we schulen turne aen to ou.
 and he took the trees of brent sacrifice and puttide on ysaac his sone.
 forsothe he bar fier and a swerd in hise hondis.
 and whanne thei tweyne eden togidere isaac seide to his fadir my fadir.
 and he answerde what wolt thou sone.
 he seide lo.
 fier and trees where is the beeste of brent sacrifice.
 abraham seide my sone god schal puruey to hym the beeste of brent sacrifice.
 therfor thei eden to gidere and camen to the place whiche god hadde schewid to hym in which place abraham bildide an auter and dresside trees aboue.
 and whanne he hadde bounde to gidere ysaac his sone he puttide ysaac in the auter on the heep of trees.
 and he helde forth his hond and took the swerd to sacrifice his sone.
 and lo.
 an aungel of the lord criede fro heuene and seide abraham.
 abraham.
 which answerde i am present.
 and the aungel seide to hym holde thou not forth thin honde on the child nether do thou ony thing to him.
 now y haue knowe that thou dredist god and sparidist not thin oon gendrid sone for me.
 abraham reiside hise ien and he sei bihynde his bak a ram cleuynge bi hornes among breris which he took and offride brent sacrifice for the sone.
 and he clepide the name of that place the lord seeth.
 wherfore it is seyd til to dai the lord schal see in the hil.
 forsothe the aungel of the lord clepide abraham the secounde tyme fro heuene and seide the lord seith y haue swore bi my silf for thou hast do this thing and hast not sparid thin oon gendrid for me y schal blesse thee and y schal multiplie thi seed as the sterris of heuene and as grauel which is in the brynk of the see.
 thi seed schal gete the atis of hise enemyes.
 and alle the folkis of erthe schulen be blessid in thi seed for thou obeiedist to my vois.
 abraham turnede aen to hise children and thei eden to bersabee togidere and he dwellide there.
 and so whanne these thingis weren don it was teld to abraham that also melcha hadde bore sones to nachor his brother.
 hus the firste gendrid and buz his brothir and chamuhel the fadir of sireis and cased and asan and feldas and jedlaf and batuhel of whom rebecca was borun.
 melcha childide these eite to nachor brother of abraham.
 forsothe his concubyn roma bi name childide thabee and gaon and thaas and maacha.
 forsothe sare lyuede an hundrid and seuene and twenti eer and diede in the citee of arbee which is ebron in the lond of chanaan.
 and abraham cam to biweyle and biwepe hir.
 and whanne he hadde rise fro the office of the deed bodi he spak to the sones of heth and seide y am a comelyng and a pilgrym anentis ou.
 yue e to me rit of sepulcre with ou that y birie my deed body.
 and the sones of heth answeriden and seiden lord here thou vs.
 thou art the prince of god anentis vs.
 birie thou thi deed bodi in oure chosun sepulcris and no man schal mow forbede thee that ne thou birie thi deed bodi in the sepulcre of him.
 and abraham roos and worschipide the puple of the lond that is the sones of heth.
 and he seide to hem if it plesith oure soule that y birie my deed bodi here e me and preie e for me to efron the sone of seor that he yue to me the double caue whiche he hath in the vttirmoste part of his feeld.
 for sufficiaunt money yue he it to me bifore ou into possessioun of sepulcre.
 forsothe efron dwellide in the myddis of the sones of heth.
 and efron answerde to abraham while alle men herden that entriden bi the ate of that citee and seide my lord it schal not be doon so but more herkne thou that that y seie.
 y yue to thee the feeld and the denne which is therine while the sones of my puple ben present.
 birie thou thi deed bodi.
 abraham worschipide bifor the lord and bifor the puple of the lond and he spak to efron while his puple stood aboute y biseche that thou here me.
 y schal yue money for the feeld resseyue thou it and so y schal birie my deed bodi in the feeld.
 and efron answerde my lord here thou me the lond which thou axist is worth foure hundrid siclis of siluer that is the prijs bitwixe me and thee but hou myche is this.
 birie thou thi deed bodi.
 and whanne abraham hadde herd this he noumbride the monei which efron axide while the sones of heth herden foure hundrid siclis of siluer and of preuyd comyn monei.
 and the feeld that was sumtyme of efron in which feeld was a double denne biholdinge to mambre as wel thilke feeld as the denne and alle the trees therof in alle termes therof bi cumpas was confermed to abraham in to possessioun while the sones of heth seien and alle men that entriden bi the ate of that citee.
 and so abraham biriede sare his wijf in the double denne of the feeld that bihelde to mambre.
 this is ebron in the lond of chanaan.
 and the feeld and the denne that was therynne was confermyd of the sones of heth to abraham in to possessioun of sepulcre.
 forsothe abraham was eld and of many daies and the lord hadde blessid hym in alle thingis.
 and he seide to the eldere seruaunt of his hows that was souereyn on alle thingis that he hadde put thou thin hond vndur myn hipe that y coniure thee bi the lord god of heuene and of erthe that thou take not a wijf to my sone of the doutris of chanaan among whiche y dwelle.
 but that thou go to my lond and kynrede and therof take a wijf to my sone ysaac.
 the seruaunt aunswerde if the womman nyle come with me in to this lond whether y owe lede aen thi sone to the place fro which thou edist out.
 abraham seide be war lest ony tyme thou lede aen thidur my sone.
 the lord of heuene that took me fro the hows of my fadir and fro the lond of my birthe which spak to me and swoor and seide y schal yue this lond to thi seed he schal sende his aungel bifore thee and thou schalt take fro thennus a wijf to my sone.
 forsothe if the womman nyle sue thee thou schalt not be holdun bi the ooth.
 netheles lede not aen my sone thidur.
 therfore the seruaunt puttide his hond vndur the hipe of abraham his lord and swoor to him on this word.
 and he took ten camels of the floc of his lord and ede forth and bar with him of alle the goodis of his lord.
 and he ede forth and cam to mesopotanye to the citee of nachor.
 and whanne he hadde maad the camels to reste with out the citee bisidis the pit of watir in the euentid in that tyme in which wymmen ben wont to go out to drawe watir he seide lord god of my lord abraham y biseche meete with me to dai and do mersi with my lord abraham.
 lo.
 y stonde ny the welle of watir and the doutris of enhabiters of this citee schulen go out to drawe watir.
 therfor the damysel to which y schal seie bowe doun thi watir pot that y drynke and schal answere drynke thou but also y schal yue drynke to thi camels thilke it is which thou hast maad redi to thi seruaunt ysaac.
 and bi this y schal vndirstonde that thou hast do mersi with my lord abraham.
 and he hadde not it fillid the wordis with ynne hym silf and lo.
 rebecca the doutir of batuel sone of melcha wijf of nachor brothir of abraham ede out hauynge a watir pot in hir schuldre.
 a damysel ful comeli and faireste virgyn and vnknowun of man.
 sotheli sche cam doun to the welle and fillide the watir pot and turnide aen.
 and the seruaunt mette hir and seide yue thou to me a litil of the watir of thi pot to drynke.
 which answerde drynke thou my lord.
 and anoon sche dide doun the watir pot on hir schuldre and af drynk to hym.
 and whanne he hadde drunke sche addide but also y schal drawe watir to thi camelis til alle drynken.
 and sche helde out the watir pot in trouis and ran aen to the pit to drawe watir and sche af watir drawun to alle the camels.
 sotheli he bihelde hir priueli and wolde wite whether the lord hadde sped his wei ethir nay.
 therfor after that the camels drunken the man broute forth goldun eere ryngis weiynge twei siclis and as many bies of the arm in the weite of ten siclis.
 and he seide to hir whos douter art thou.
 schewe thou to me is ony place in the hows of thi fadir to dwelle.
 which answerde y am the douter of batuel sone of nachor whom melcha childide to him.
 and sche addide seiynge also ful myche of prouendre and of hey is at vs and a large place to dwelle.
 the man bowide hym silf and worschipide the lord and seide blessid be the lord god of my lord abraham which god took not aweie his mersy and treuthe fro my lord and ledde me bi rit weie in to the hous of the brother of my lord.
 and so the damesel ran and telde in the hous of hir modir alle thingis whiche sche hadde herd.
 sotheli rebecca hadde a brothir laban bi name whiche ede out hastili to the man where he was with out forth.
 and whanne he hadde seyn the eere ryngis and byes of the arm in the hondis of his sister and hadde herd alle the wordis of hir tellynge the man spak to me these thingis he cam to the man that stood bisidis the camels and ny the welle of watir and seide to him entre thou the blessid of the lord.
 whi stondist thou with outforth.
 i haue maad redi the hows and a place to thi camels.
 and he broute hym in to the ynne and unsadlide the camels and af prouendre and hey and watir to waische the feet of camels and of men that camen with hym.
 and breed was set forth in his sit which seide y schal not ete til y speke my wordis.
 he answerde to the man speke thou.
 and the man seide y am the seruaunt of abraham and the lord hath blessid my lord greetli and he is maad greet.
 and god af to hym scheep and oxun siluer and gold seruauntis and handmaides camels and assis.
 and sare the wijf of my lord childide a sone to my lord in his eelde and he af alle thingis that he hadde to that sone.
 and my lord chargide me greetli and seide thou schalt not take to my sone a wijf of the doutris of canaan in whos lond y dwelle but thou schalt go to the hous of my fadir and of myn kynrede thou schalt take a wijf to my sone.
 forsothe y answerde to my lord what if the womman nyle come with me.
 he seide the lord in whose sit y go schal sende his aungel with thee and he schal dresse thi weie.
 and thou schalt take a wijf to my sone of my kynrede and of my fadris hows.
 thou schalt be innocent fro my curs whanne thou comest to my kynesmen and thei yuen not the womman to thee.
 therfor y cam to day to the welle of watir and y seide lord god of my lord abraham if thou hast dressid my weie in which y go now lo.
 y stonde bisidis the welle of watir and the maide that schal go out to drawe watir herith me yue thou to me a litil of water to drynke of thi pot and seith to me and thou drynke and y schal drawe watir to thi camels thilke is the womman which the lord hath maad redi to the sone of my lord.
 while y turnede in thoute these thingis with me rebecca apperide comynge with a pot which sche bare in the schuldre.
 and sche ede doun to the welle and drowe watir.
 and y seide to hir yue thou a litil to me to drynke.
 and sche hastide and dide doun the pot of the schuldre and seide to me and thou drynke and y schal yue drynke to thi camels.
 y drank and watride the camels.
 and y axide hir and seide whos doutir art thou.
 which answerde y am the doutir of batuel sone of nachor whom melcha childide to him.
 and so y hangide eere ryngis to ourne hir face and y puttide bies of the arm in hir hondis and lowliche y worschipide the lord and y blessid the lord god of my lord abraham which god ledde me bi rit weie that y schulde take the doutir of the brothir of my lord to his sone.
 wherfor if e don mercy and treuthe with my lord schewe e to me.
 ellis if othir thing plesith also seie e this that y go to the rit side ethir to the left side.
 laban and batuel answeriden the word is gon out of the lord.
 we moun not speke ony other thing with thee without his plesaunce.
 lo.
 rebecca is bifore thee.
 take thou hir and go forth and be sche wijf of the sone of thi lord as the lord spak.
 and whanne the child of abraham hadde herd this he felde doun and worschipide the lord in erthe.
 and whanne vessels of siluer and of gold and clothis weren brout forth he af tho to rebecca for ifte and he af iftis to hir britheren and modir.
 and whanne a feeste was maad thei eeten and drunken to gider and dwelliden there.

 he that ede out first was reed and al rou in the manere of a skyn.
 and his name was clepid esau.
 anoon the tothir ede out and helde with the hond the heele of the brother.
 and therfore he clepide him jacob.
 isaac was sixti eer eeld whanne the litle children weren borun.
 and whanne thei weren woxun esau was maad a man kunnynge of huntyng and a man erthe tilier.
 forsothe jacob was a symple man and dwellide in tabernaclis.
 isaac louyde esau for he eet of the huntyng of esau.

 forsothe for hungur roos on the lond aftir thilke bareynesse that bifelde in the daies of abraham isaac ede forth to abymelech kyng of palestyns in gerara.
 and the lord apperide to hym and seide go not doun in to egipt but reste thou in the lond which y schal seie to thee and be thou a pilgrym ther ynne.
 and y schal be with thee and y schal blesse thee.
 for y schal yue alle these cuntrees to thee and to thi seed and y schal fille the ooth which y bihite to abraham thi fadir.
 and y schal multiplie thi seed as the sterris of heuene and y schal yue alle these thingis to thin eyris and alle folkis of erthe schulen be blessid in thi seed for abraham obeide to my vois and kepte my preceptis and comaundementis and kepte cerymonyes and lawis.
 and so ysaac dwellide in geraris.

 and the lord blesside hym.
 and the man was maad riche and he ede profitynge and encreessynge til he was maad ful greet.
 also he hadde possessioun of scheep and grete beestis and ful myche of meyne.
 for this thing palestyns hadden enuye to hym and thei stoppiden in that tyme and filliden with erthe alle the pittis whiche the seruauntis of abraham his fadir hadden diggid in so myche that abymelech him silf seide to ysaac go thou awei fro vs for thou art maad greetly mytier than we.

 and he diggide eft other pittis whiche the seruauntis of abraham his fadir hadden diggid and whiche the filisteis hadden stoppid sumtyme whanne abraham was deed.
 and he clepide tho pittis bi the same names bi whiche his fadir hadde clepid bifore.
 thei diggiden in the stronde and thei founden wellynge watir.
 but also strijf of scheepherdis of gerare was there aens the scheepherdis of isaac and thei seiden the watir is oure.
 wherfor of that that bifelde he clepide the name of the pit fals chaleng.

 and he ede forth fro thennus and diggide another pit for which thei stryueden not therfor he clepid the name of that pit largenesse.
 and seide now god hath alargid vs and hath maad to encreesse on erthe.
 forsothe he stiede fro that place in to bersabee where the lord god apperide to him in that nyt.
 and seide y am god of abraham thi fadir.
 nyle thou drede for y am with thee and y schal blesse thee and y schal multiplie thi seed for my seruaunt abraham.
 and so ysaac bildide ther an auter to the lord.
 and whanne the name of the lord was inwardli clepid he stretchide forth a tabernacle.
 and he comaundide hise seruauntis that thei schulden digge pittis.
 and whanne abymelech and ochosat hise frendis and ficol duk of knytis hadden come fro geraris to that place isaac spak to hem what camen e to me a man whom e hatiden and puttiden awei fro ou.
 whiche answeriden we seien that god is with thee and therfor we seiden now an ooth be bitwixe vs and make we a couenaunt of pees that thou do not ony yuel to vs as we touchiden not ony thing of thine nethir diden that that hirtide thee but with pees we leften thee encressid bi the blessyng of the lord.
 therfor isaac made a feeste to hem.
 and after mete and drynk thei risen eerli and sworen ech to other.
 and isaac lefte hem peisibli in to her place.
 lo.
 forsothe in that dai the seruauntis of ysaac camen tellynge to him of the pit which thei hadden diggid and seiden we han foundun watir.
 wherfor ysaac clepide that pit abundaunce.

 forsothe whanne the late medlyng and the laste conseyuyng weren jacob puttide not tho erdis.
 and tho that weren late weren maad labans and tho that weren of the firste tyme weren jacobis.
 and he was maad ful riche and hadde many flockis handmaydis and seruauntis camels and assis.
 aftir that jacob herde the wordis of the sones of laban that seiden jacob hath take awei alle thingis that weren oure fadris and of his catel jacob is maad riche and noble.
 also jacob perseyuede the face of laban that it was not aens hym as istirdai and the thridde dai agoon moost for the lord seide to hym turne aen into the lond of thi fadris and to thi generacioun and y shal be with thee.
 he sente and clepide rachel and lya in to the feeld where he kepte flockis and he seide to hem y se the face of oure fadir that it is not aens me as isterdai and the thridde dai agoon.
 but god of my fadir was with me.

 and netheles god suffride not hym to anoye me.
 if he seide ony tyme dyuerse colourid sheep schulen be thi medis alle sheep brouten forth dyuerse colourid lambren.
 forsothe whanne he seide aenward thou shalte take alle white for mede alle the flockis brouten forth white beestis.

 and rachel and lya answeriden wher we han ony thing residue in the catels and eritage of oure fadir.
 wher he arettide not vs as aliens and selde and eet oure prijs.
 but god took awei the richessis of oure fadir and af tho to vs and to oure sones.
 wherfor do thou alle thingis whiche god hath comaundide to thee.
 forsothe jacob roos and puttide hise fre children and wyues on camels and ede forth.
 and he took al his catel flockis and what euer thing he hadde gete in mesopotanye and ede to isaac his fadir into the lond of canaan.
 in that tyme laban ede to schere scheep and rachel stal the idols of hir fadir.
 and jacob nolde knouleche to the fadir of his wijf that he wolde fle.
 and whanne he hadde go as wel he as alle thingis that weren of his rit and whanne he hadde passid the water and he ede aens the hil of galaad it was teld to laban in the thridde dai that jacob fledde.
 and laban took his britheren and pursuede hym seuene daies and took hym in the hil of galaad.
 and laban sei in sleep the lord seiynge to him be war that thou speke not ony thing sharpli aens jacob.
 and thanne jacob hadde stretchid forth the tabernacle in the hil.
 and whanne he hadde sued jacob with his britheren he settide tente in the same hil of galaad.
 and he seide to jacob whi hast thou do so that the while i wiste not thou woldist dryue awey my doutris as caitifs by swerd.
 whi woldist thou fle the while y wiste not nether woldist shewe to me that y shulde sue thee with ioie and songis and tympans and harpis.

 jacob answeride that y ede forth while thou wistist not y dredde lest thou woldist take awey thi doutris violentli.
 sotheli that thou repreuest me of thefte at whom euer thou fyndist thi goddis be he slayn bifor oure britheren.
 seke thou what euer thing of thine thou fyndist at me and take awei.
 jacob seide these thingis and wiste not that rachel stal the idols.
 and so laban entride into the tabernacle of jacob and of lya and of euer eithir meyne and foond not.
 and whanne laban hadde entrid in to the tente of rachel sche hastide and hidde the idols vndur the strewyngis of the camel and sat aboue.
 and sche seide to laban sekynge al the tente and fyndynge no thing my lord be not wrooth that y may not rise bifore thee for it bifelde now to me bi the custom of wymmen.
 so the bisynesse of the sekere was scorned.
 and jacob bolnyde and seide with strijf for what cause of me and for what synne of me hast thou come so fersly aftir me and hast sout al the portenaunce of myn hous.
 what hast thou founde of al the catel of thin hows.

 y was angwischid in dai and nyt with heete and frost and sleep fledde fro myn ien.
 so y seruede thee bi twenti eer in thin hows fourtene eer for thi doutris and sixe eer for thi flockis.
 and thou chaungidist my mede ten sithis.
 if god of my fadir abraham and the drede of isaac hadde not helpid me perauenture now thou haddist left me nakid.
 the lord bihelde my turmentyng and the traueyl of myn hondis and repreuyde thee istirdai.

 forsothe israel louyde joseph ouer alle hise sones for he hadde gendrid hym in eelde.
 and he made to joseph a cote of many colours.
 forsothe hise britheren sien that he was loued of the fader more than alle and thei hatiden hym and myten not speke ony thing pesibli to hym.
 and it bifelde that he telde to hise britheren a sweuene seyn which cause was the seed of more hatrede.
 and joseph seide to his britheren here e the sweuene which y sei y gesside that we bounden to gidere handfuls and that as myn handful roos and stood and that oure handfuls stoden aboute and worschipiden myn handful.
 hise britheren answerden whether thou shalt be oure kyng ethir we shulen be maad suget to thi lordschip.
 therfor this cause of sweuenys and wordis mynystride the nurschyng of enuye and of hatrede.
 also joseph sei another sweuene which he telde to the britheren and seide y sei bi a sweuene that as the sunne and moone and enleuen sterris worschipiden me.
 and whanne he hadde teld this sweuene to his fadir and britheren his fadir blamyde him and seide what wole this sweuene to it silf which thou hast seyn.
 whether y and thi modir and thi britheren schulen worschipe thee on erthe.
 therfor hise britheren hadden enuye to hym.
 forsothe the fadir bihelde pryuely the thing and whanne his britheren dwelliden in sichem aboute flockis of the fadir to be kept israel seide to joseph thi britheren kepen scheep in sichymys.
 come thou y schal sende thee to hem.
 and whanne joseph answerde y am redi israel seide go thou and se whether alle thingis ben esi anentis thi britheren and scheep.
 and telle thou to me what is doon.
 he was sent fro the valey of ebron and cam into sichem.
 and a man foond hym errynge in the feeld and the man axide what he soute.
 and he answerde y seke my britheren schewe thou to me where thei kepten flockis.
 and the man seide to hym thei eden awei fro this place.
 forsothe y herde hem seiynge go we into dothaym.
 and joseph ede aftir his britheren and foond hem in dothaym.
 and whanne thei hadden seyn hym afer bifor that he neiede to hem thei thouten to sle hym and spaken togidere lo.
 the dremere cometh come e sle we hym and sende we into an eld sisterne and we schulen seie a wielde beeste ful wickid hath deuourid hym.
 and thanne it schal appere what hise dremes profiten to hym.
 sotheli ruben herde this and enforside to delyuere hym fro her hondis and seide sle we not the lijf of hym nether schede we out his blood but caste e hym into an eeld cisterne which is in the wildirnesse and kepe e oure hondis gilteles.
 forsothe he seide this willynge to delyuere hym fro her hondis and to elde to his fadir.
 therfor anoon as joseph cam to hise britheren thei dispuyliden hym of the coote doun to the heele and of many colours and senten into the eeld cisterne that hadde no water.
 and thei saten to ete breed.
 and thei sien that ismaelitis weigoers camen fro galaad and that her camels baren swete smellynge spiceries and rosyn and stacten into egipt.
 therfor judas seide to hise britheren what schal it profite to vs if we schulen sle oure brother and schulen hide his blood.
 it is betere that he be seeld to ismalitis and oure hondis be not defoulid for he is oure brother and fleisch.
 the britheren assentiden to these wordis.
 and whanne marchauntis of madian passiden forth thei drowen hym out of the cisterne and seelden hym to ismaelitis for thritti platis of siluer.
 whiche ledden hym in to egipt.
 and ruben turnede aen to the cisterne and foond not the child.
 and he torente his clothis and he ede to hise britheren and seide the child apperith not and whidir schal y go.
 forsothe thei token his coote and dippiden in the blood of a kide which thei hadden slayn.
 and senten men that baren to the fadir and seiden we han founde this coote se whether it is the coote of thi sone ether nai.
 and whanne the fader hadde knowe it he seide it is the coote of my sone a wielde beeste ful wickid hath ete hym a beeste hath deuourid joseph.
 and he torente his clothis and he was clothid with an heire and biweilide his sone in myche tyme.
 sothely whanne hise fre children weren gaderid to gidere that thei schulden peese the sorewe of the fadir he nolde take counfort but seide y schal go doun in to helle and schal biweile my sone.
 and the while jacob contynude in wepyng madianytis seelden joseph into egipt to putifar chast and onest seruaunt of farao maistir of the chyualrie.
 yn the same tyme judas ede doun fro his britheren and turnede to a man of odolla hiram bi name.
 and he si ther a doutir of a man of canaan sue bi name.
 and whanne he hadde takun hir to wijf he entride to hir and sche conseyuede and childide a sone and clepide his name her.
 and eft whanne a child was conseyued sche nemyde the child borun onam.
 and sche childide the thridde sone whom sche clepide cela and whanne he was borun sche ceesside to bere child more.
 forsothe judas af a wijf thamar bi name to his firste gendrid sone her.
 and her the firste gendrid sone of judas was weiward in the sit of the lord and therfor he was slayn of the lord.
 therfor judas seide to onam his sone entre thou to the wijf of thi brothir and be thou felouschipid to hir that thou reise seed to thi brothir.
 and he wiste that sones schulden not be borun to him and he entride to the wijf of his brother and schedde seed in to the erthe lest the fre children schulden be borun bi the name of the brother.
 and therfor the lord smoot hym for he dide abhomynable thing.
 wherfor judas seide to thamar wijf of his sone be thou widewe in the hous of thi fadir til sela my sone wexe for he dredde lest also he schulde die as hise britheren.
 and sche ede and dwellide in the hous of hir fadir.
 forsothe whanne many eeris weren passid the douter of sue the wijf of juda diede and whanne coumfort was takun aftir morenyng he stiede to the schereris of hise scheep he and iras of odolla that was kepere of the floc stieden in to thampnas.

 and sche dide awei the clothis of widewehod and sche took a roket and whanne the clothinge was chaungid sche sat in the weilot that ledith to tampna.
 for sela hadde woxe and sche hadde not take hym to hosebonde.
 and whanne judas hadde seyn hir he supposide hir to be an hoore for sche hadde hilid hir face lest sche were knowun.
 and judas entride to hir and seide suffre me that y ligge with thee.
 for he wiste not that sche was the wijf of his sone.
 and whanne sche answeride what schalt thou yue to me that thou ligge bi me.
 he seide y schal sende to thee a kide of the flockis.
 and eft whanne sche seide y schal suffre that that thou wolt if thou schalt yue to me a wed til thou sendist that that thou bihetist.
 judas seide what wolt thou that be ouun to thee for a wed.
 she answeride thi ryng and thi bie of the arm and the staaf which thou holdist in the hond.
 therfor the womman conseyuide at o liggyng bi and sche roos and ede.
 and whanne the clooth was put awei which sche hadde take sche was clothid in the clothis of widewhod.
 forsothe judas sente a kide bi his scheepherde of odolla that he schulde resseyue the wed which he hadde oue to the womman.
 and whanne he hadde not founde hir he axide men of that place where is the womman that sat in the weie lot.
 and whanne alle men answeriden an hoore was not in this place.
 he turnede aen to judas and seide to hym y foond not hir but also men of that place seiden to me that an hoore sat neuere there.
 judas seide haue sche to hir silf certis sche may not repreue vs of a leesyng.
 y sente the kyde which y bihite and thou foundist not hir.
 lo.
 sotheli aftir thre monethis thei telden to judas and seiden thamar wijf of thi sone hath do fornycacioun and hir womb semeth to wexe greet.
 judas seide brynge e hir forth that sche be brent.
 and whanne sche was led to peyne sche sente to the fadir of hir hosebonde and seide y haue conseyued of the man whose these thingis ben.
 knowe thou whose is the ryng and bie of the arm and staf.
 and whanne the iftis weren knowun he seide sche is more iust than y for y af not hir to sela my sone.
 netheles judas knewe hir no more fleischli.
 sotheli whanne the childberyng neiede twei chyldren apperiden in the wombe and in that birthe of children oon broute forth the hond in which the mydwijf boond a reed threed and seide this schal go out the formere.
 sotheli while he withdrowe the hond the tother ede out and the womman seide whi was the skyn in which the child lay in the wombe departid for thee.
 and for this cause sche clepide his name fares.
 afterward his brothir ede out in whos hond was the reed threed whom sche clepide zaram.
 therfor joseph was led in to egipt and putifar chast and onest seruaunt of farao prince of the oost a man of egipt boute hym of the hondis of ismaelitis of which he was brout.
 and the lord was with hym and he was a man doynge with prosperite in alle thingis.
 and joseph dwellide in the hows of his lord which knew best that the lord was with joseph and that alle thingis whiche he dide weren dressid of the lord in the hond of hym.
 and joseph foond grace bifor his lord and mynystride to hym of whom joseph was maad souereyn of alle thingis and gouernede the hows bitaken to hym and alle thingis that weren bitakun to hym.
 and the lord blesside the hows of egipcian for joseph and multipliede al his catel as wel in howsis as in feeldis.
 nether he knew ony other thing no but breed which he eet.
 forsothe joseph was fair in face and schapli in sit.
 and so aftir many daies the ladi castide hir ien in to joseph and seide slepe thou with me.
 which assentide not to the vnleueful werk and seide to hir lo.
 while alle thingis ben bitakun to me my lord woot not what he hath in his hows nether ony thing is which is not in my power ether which he hath not bitake to me outakun thee which art his wijf.
 how therfor may y do this yuel and do synne aens my lord.
 thei spaken siche wordis bi alle daies and the womman was diseseful to the ong waxynge man and he forsook auoutrie.
 forsothe it bifelde in a dai that joseph entride in to the hows and dide sum werk with out witnessis.
 and sche took the hem of his clooth and sche seide slepe thou with me.
 and he lefte the mentil in hir hoond and he fledde and ede out.
 and whanne the womman hadde seyn the clooth in hir hondis and that sche was dispisid sche clepide to hir the men of hir hows and seide to hem lo.
 my lord hath brout in an ebrew man that he schulde scorn vs.
 he entride to me to do leccherie with me and whanne y criede and he herde my vois he lefte the mentil which y helde and he fledde out.
 therfor in to the preuyng of trouthe sche schewide the mantil holdun to the hosebonde turnynge aen hoom.
 and she seide the ebrew seruaunt whom thou broutist entride to me to scorne me.
 and whanne he si me crye he lefte the mentil which y helde and he fledde out.
 and whanne these thingis weren herd the lord bileuyde ouer myche to the wordis of the wijf and was ful wrooth.
 and he bitook joseph in to prisoun where the bounden men of the kyng weren kept and he was closid there.
 forsothe the lord was with joseph and hadde mercy on hym and af grace to hym in the sit of the prince of the prisoun which bitook in the hond of joseph alle prisoneris that weren holdun in kepyng and what euer thing was doon it was vndur joseph nethir the prince knewe ony thing for alle thingis weren bitakun to joseph.
 for the lord was with hym and dresside alle his werkis.
 whanne these thingis weren doon so it bifelde that twei geldyngis the boteler and the baker of the kyng of egipt synneden to her lord.
 and farao was wrooth aens hem for the toon was souereyn to boteleris the tother was souereyn to bakeris.
 and he sente hem in to the prisoun of the prince of knytis in which also joseph was boundun.
 and the keper of the prisoun bitook hem to joseph which also mynystride to hem.
 sumdel of tyme passide and thei weren hooldun in kepyng and bothe sien a dreem in o nyt bi couenable expownyng to hem.
 and whanne joseph hadde entrid to hem eerli and hadde seyn hem sori he axide hem and seide whi is oure face soriere to dai than it ys wont.
 whiche answeriden we seien a dreem and noon is that expowneth to vs.
 and joseph seide to hem whether expownyng is not of god.
 telle e to me what e han seyn.
 the souereyn of boteleris telde first his dreem.
 y sei that a vyne bifore me in which weren thre siouns wexide litil and litil in to buriounnyngis and that aftir flouris grapys wexiden ripe and the cuppe of farao was in myn hond.
 therfor y took the grapis and presside out in to the cuppe which y helde and y af drynk to farao.
 joseph answerde this is the expownyng of the dreem.
 thre siouns ben it thre daies aftir whiche farao schal haue mynde of thi seruyce and he schal restore thee in to the firste degree and thou schal yue to hym the cuppe bi thin office as thou were wont to do bifore.
 oneli haue thou mynde on me whanne it is wel to thee and thou schalt do merci with me that thou make suggestioun to farao that he lede me out of this prisoun.
 for theefli y am takun a wei fro the lond of ebrews and here y am sent innocent in to prisoun.
 the maister of bakeris seie that joseph hadde expowned prudentli the dreem and he seide and y sei a dreem that y hadde thre panyeris of mele on myn heed and y gesside that y bar in o panyere that was heiere alle metis that ben maad bi craft of bakers and that briddis eeten therof.
 joseph answerde this is the expownyng of the dreem.
 thre panyeris ben it thre daies aftir whiche farao schal take awei thin heed and he schal hange thee in a cros and briddis schulen todrawe thi fleischis.
 fro thennus the thridde dai was the dai of birthe of farao which made a greet feeste to hise children and hadde mynde among metis on the maistir of boteleris and on the prince of bakeris.
 and he restoride the oon in to his place that he schulde dresse cuppe to the kyng and he hangide the tothir in a gebat that the treuthe of the expownere schulde be preued.
 and netheles whanne prosperitees bifelden the souereyn of boteleris forat his expownere.
 aftir twei eer farao sei a dreem.
 he gesside that he stood on a flood fro which seuene faire kiyn and ful fatte stieden and weren fed in the places of mareis.
 and othere seuene foule and leene camen out of the flood and weren fed in thilk brenke of the watir in grene places.
 and tho deuoureden thilke kien of whiche the fairnesse and comelynesse of bodies was wondurful.
 farao wakide and slepte eft and sei another dreem.
 seuen eeris of corn ful and faire camen forth in o stalke and othere as many eeris of corn thinne and smytun with corrupcioun of brennynge wynd camen forth deuourynge al the fairenesse of the firste.
 farao wakide aftir reste and whanne morewtid was maad he was aferd bi inward drede and he sente to alle the expowneris of egipt and to alle wise men.
 and whanne thei weren clepid he telde the dreem and noon was that expownede.
 thanne at the laste the maistir of boteleris bithoute and seide y knowleche my synne.
 the kyng was wrooth to hise seruauntis and comaundide me and the maister of bakeris to be cast doun in to the prisoun of the prince of knytis where we bothe saien a dreem in o nyt biforeschewynge of thingis to comynge.
 an ebrew child seruaunt of the same duk of knytis was there to whom we telden the dremes and herden what euer thing the bifallyng of thing preuede afterward.
 for y am restorid to myn office and he was hangid in a cros.
 anoon at the comaundement of the kyng thei polliden joseph led out of prisoun and whanne the clooth was chaungid thei brouten joseph to the kyng.
 to whom the kyng seide y seie dremes and noon is that expowneth tho thingis that y sei i haue herd that thou expownest moost prudentli.
 joseph answerde with out me god schal answere prosperitees to farao.
 therfor farao telde that that he sei.
 y gesside that y stood on the brenke of the flood and seuene kiyn ful faire and with fleischis able to etyng stieden fro the watir whiche kiyn gaderiden grene seggis in the pasture of the marreis.
 and lo.
 seuene othere kiyn so foule and leene sueden these that y sei neuere siche in the lond of egipt.
 and whanne the formere kien weren deuourid and wastid tho secounde auen no steppe of fulnesse but weren slowe bi lijk leenesse and palenesse.
 i wakide and eft y was oppressid bi sleep and y sei a dreem.
 seuene eeris of corn ful and faireste camen forth in o stalke and othere seuene thinne and smytun with corrupcioun of brennynge wynd camen forth of the stobil whiche deuouriden the fairenesse of the formere.
 y telde the dreem to expowneris and no man is that expowneth.
 joseph answerde the dreem of the king is oon.
 god schewide to farao what thingis he schal do.
 seuene faire kiyn and seuene ful eeris of corn ben seuene eeris of plentee and tho comprehenden the same strengthe of dreem.
 and seuene kiyn thinne and leene that stieden aftir tho and seuene thinne eeris of corn and smytun with brennynge wynd ben seuene eer of hungur to comynge whiche schulen be fillid bi this ordre.
 lo.
 seuene eer of greet plentee in al the lond of egipt schulen come and seuene othre eer of so greet bareynesse schulen sue tho that al the abundaunce bifore be ouun to foretyng.
 for the hungur schal waste al the lond and the greetnesse of pouert schal leese the greetnesse of plentee.
 forsothe this that thou siest the secunde tyme a dreem perteynynge to the same thing is a schewyng of sadnesse for the word of god schal be doon and schal be fillid ful swiftli.
 now therfor puruey the kyng a wijs man and a redi and make the kyng hym souereyn to the lond of egipt which man ordeyne gouernouris bi alle cuntreis and gadere he in to bernys the fyuethe part of fruytis bi seuene eer of plentee that schulen come now.
 and al the wheete be kept vndur the power of farao and be it kept in citees and be it maad redi to the hungur to comynge of seuene eer that schal oppresse egipt and the lond be not wastid bi pouert.
 the counsel pleside farao and alle his mynystris and he spak to hem wher we moun fynde sich a man which is ful of goddis spirit.
 therfor farao seide to joseph for god hath schewid to thee alle thingis whiche thou hast spoke wher y mai fynde a wisere man and lijk thee.
 therfor thou schalt be ouer myn hous and al the puple schal obeie to the comaundement of thi mouth.
 y schal passe thee onely by o trone of the rewme.
 and eft farao seide to joseph lo.
 y haue ordeyned thee on al the lond of egipt.
 and farao took the ryng fro his hond and af it in the hond of joseph and he clothide joseph with a stoole of bijs and puttide a goldun wrethe aboute the necke.
 and farao made joseph to stie on his secounde chare while a bidele criede that alle men schulden knele bifore hym and schulden knowe that he was souereyn of al the lond of egipt.
 and the kyng seide to joseph y am farao without thi comaundement no man shal stire hond ether foot in al the lond of egipt.
 and he turnede the name of joseph and clepide him bi egipcian langage the sauyour of the world.
 and he af to joseph a wijf asenech the douter of potifar preest of heliopoleos.
 and so joseph ede out to the lond of egipt.
 forsothe joseph was of thretti eer whanne he stood in the sit of kyng farao and cumpasside alle the cuntreis of egipt.
 and the plente of seuene eer cam and ripe corn weren bounden into handfuls and weren gaderid into the bernys of egipt also al the aboundaunce of cornes weren kept in alle citeis and so greet aboundaunce was of wheete that it was maad euene to the grauel of the see and the plente passide mesure.
 sotheli twei sones were born to joseph bifor that the hungur came whiche asenech doutir of putifar preest of heliopoleos childide to hym.
 and he clepide the name of the firste gendrid sone manasses and seide god hath maad me to forete alle my traueilis and the hous of my fadir.
 and he clepide the name of the secunde sone effraym and seide god hath maad me to encreesse in the lond of my pouert.
 therfor whanne seuene eer of plentee that weren in egipt weren passid seuene eer of pouert bigunnen to come whiche joseph bifore seide and hungur hadde the maistri in al the world.
 also hungur was in al the lond of egipt.
 and whanne that lond hungride the puple criede to farao and axide metis.
 to whiche he answeride go e to joseph and do e what euer thing he seith to ou.
 forsothe hungur encreesside ech dai in al the lond and joseph openyde alle the bernys and seelde to egipcians for also hungur oppresside hem.
 and alle prouynces camen in to egipt to bie metis and to abate the yuel of nedynesse.
 forsothe jacob herde that foodis weren seeld in egipt and he seide to hise sones whi ben e necgligent.
 y herde that wheete is seeld in egipt go e doun and bie e necessaries to vs that we moun lyue and be not wastid bi nedynesse.
 therfor ten britheren of joseph eden doun to bie wheete in egipt and beniamyn was withholdun of jacob at hoome that seide to hise britheren lest perauenture in the weie he suffre ony yuel.
 sotheli thei entriden in to the lond of egipt with othere men that eden to bie.
 forsothe hungur was in the lond of canaan.
 and joseph was prince of egipt and at his wille whetis weren seeld to puplis.
 and whanne hise britheren hadden worschipid hym and he hadde knowe hem he spak hardere as to aliens and axide hem fro whennus camen e.
 whiche answeriden fro the lond of canaan that we bie necessaries to lyiflode.
 and netheles he knewe the britheren and he was not knowun of hem and he bithoute on the dremys whiche he sei sumtyme.
 and he seide to hem e ben aspieris e camen to se the feblere thingis of the lond.

 alle we ben the sones of o man we comen pesible and thi seruauntis ymaginen not ony yuel.
 to whiche he answeride it is in other maner e camen to se the feble thingis of the lond.
 and thei seiden we twelue britheren thi seruauntis ben sones of o man in the lond of canaan.
 the leeste is with oure fadir an other is not on erthe.

 therfor he bitook hem to kepyng thre daies.
 sotheli in the thridde dai whanne thei weren led out of prisoun he seide do e that that y seide and e schulen lyue for y drede god.
 if e ben pesible o brother of ou be boundun in prisoun.

 thei diden as he seide and thei spaken to gidere skilfuli we suffren these thingis for we synneden aens oure brother and we seien the anguysch of his soule while he preiede vs and we herden not.
 herfore this tribulacioun cometh on vs.
 of which oon ruben seide whether y seide not to ow nyle e do synne aens the child and e herden not me.
 lo.
 his blood is sout.
 sotheli thei wisten not that joseph vndirstood for he spak to hem by interpretour.
 and he turnede a wei hym silf a litil and wepte.
 and he turnede aen and spak to hem.
 and he took symeon and boond hym while thei weren present.
 and he comaundide the mynystris that thei schulden fille her sackis with wheete and that thei schulden putte the money of alle in her baggis and ouer this yue metis in the weie.
 whiche diden so.
 and thei baren wetis on her assis and eden forth and whanne the sak of oon was opened that he schulde yue meete to the werk beeste in the yn he bihelde the money in the mouth of the bagge and seide to his britheren my monei is oldun to me lo.
